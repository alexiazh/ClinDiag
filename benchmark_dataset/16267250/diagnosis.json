        "differential_diagnosis": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right precordial ST-segment elevation and multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation without clinically detectable structural heart disease. Evidence of conduction slowing and fibrosis in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), along with a sodium channel mutation (G1935S), supported the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome. The absence of a transmural APD gradient and the nature of the arrhythmias indicated localized conduction changes as the underlying cause."
