        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patients presented with localized infections (cellulitis, edema, tenderness) that failed to improve with oral antibiotics. Some patients exhibited systemic infection signs (fever, chills). All infected implants showed significant periprosthetic fluid and positive cultures for Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, indicating ongoing infection. Surgical interventions (drainage, debridement, and device exchange) led to successful salvage of all infected implants."
