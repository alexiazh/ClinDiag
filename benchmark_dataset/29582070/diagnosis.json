        "final_diagnosis": "hereditary angiopathy, nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps (HANAC) syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with bilateral renal cysts and worsening chronic kidney disease. Genetic testing confirmed a deleterious mutation in the COL4A1 gene, indicative of HANAC syndrome, while mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 related to ADPKD were ruled out. Clinical findings, including the family history of retinal hemorrhages and muscle cramps, supported the diagnosis of HANAC syndrome over ADPKD."
