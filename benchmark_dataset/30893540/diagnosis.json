        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of anxiety and palpitations were linked to recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. The discontinuation of metoprolol likely triggered these episodes, leading to increased symptom burden, which included feelings of anxiety. Based on the history, physical examination, and cardiac evaluations, atrial fibrillation was determined as the root cause of the patient's anxiety symptoms."
