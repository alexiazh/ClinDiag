        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's severe facial erythema and itching occurred shortly after starting a new iron formulation that contained Sunset Yellow, an excipient to which the patient was later confirmed to be allergic. Patch tests showed positive reactions to orange disperse and other allergens, but only the Sunset Yellow was present in the new iron formulation."
