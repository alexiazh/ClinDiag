        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypoxemia, measurement errors, acute respiratory infections, anemia due to other causes.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's repeatedly low oxygen saturation levels on pulse oximetry, normal physical examination, and normal chest radiograph suggested a chronic cause of hypoxemia. Normal hemoglobin electrophoresis ruled out rare hemoglobin variants causing falsely low readings. The presence of dapsone use and typical symptoms indicated methemoglobinemia as the most likely cause of low SpO2 levels. Additionally, discrepancies between glycated hemoglobin and fructosamine readings pointed to dapsone-induced hemolysis, which could lead to false low hemoglobin A1c levels."
