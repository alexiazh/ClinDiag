        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of ischemic colitis leading to an exploratory laparotomy that revealed gangrene of a segment of the small bowel. Pathological examination showed transmural infarction and stenotic changes in the mesenteric artery, consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia. Digital subtraction angiography displayed a characteristic 'chain of beads' appearance in the superior mesenteric artery, confirming the diagnosis."
