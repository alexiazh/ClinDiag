        "final_diagnosis": "Stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of NSCLC was confirmed by cytologic examination from a fine-needle aspiration of the lung mass, which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The presence of neurologic symptoms (headaches, left-sided weakness, facial droop) and imaging findings (hypointense lesion in the right thalamus with peripheral enhancement) consistent with metastatic disease supported the diagnosis."
