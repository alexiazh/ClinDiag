        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent acute neurologic events, cognitive changes, and a family history of similar symptoms. Neuroimaging showed extensive white-matter lesions, and familial testing indicated a likely inherited condition. Although a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene was identified, its significance regarding CADASIL was uncertain. The combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and familial similarities leans towards CADASIL despite the atypical features observed."
