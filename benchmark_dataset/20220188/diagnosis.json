        "final_diagnosis": "POEMS syndrome with demyelinating neuropathy and solitary plasmacytoma of bone",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), Amyloidosis, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, Other demyelinating neuropathies",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited progressive sensory and motor symptoms, ascites, papilledema, and bone lesions. The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome was supported by the presence of polyneuropathy and a small monoclonal component restricted to a lambda light chain, along with additional minor criteria such as ascites, hypogonadism, and edema. Although some diagnostic criteria were not fully met, imaging and biopsy findings were consistent with a solitary plasmacytoma, confirming the POEMS syndrome."
