    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Thrombosed left middle cerebral artery aneurysm with a perianeurysmal cyst presenting as ictal psychosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Schizophrenia, temporal lobe epilepsy, alcohol withdrawal, psychiatric disorders",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's age at onset and subtle focal neurologic symptoms raised suspicion for a neurologic basis of the auditory hallucinations. Imaging showed a large cystic lesion in the left anterior temporal lobe, which was identified as a thrombosed aneurysm with a surrounding cyst. The patient's dramatic improvement with antiseizure medication indicated that the hallucinations were likely due to ictal psychosis rather than a primary psychiatric disorder."
