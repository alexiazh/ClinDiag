        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The study reported cases of five patients with SDHD (D92Y) mutations who developed malignant paragangliomas, demonstrating significant interindividual variability in clinical presentation. Malignancy was confirmed through evidence of metastasis and/or local tumor invasion, as illustrated by different manifestations such as bone metastases and lymph node involvement. Furthermore, the presence of catecholamine excess, particularly in four patients, supported the diagnosis."
