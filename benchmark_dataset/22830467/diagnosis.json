        "final_diagnosis": "Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection associated with HTLV-I infection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Celiac disease, Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), Tropical sprue, Crohnâ€™s disease, Strongyloidiasis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and significant weight loss, with laboratory findings indicative of malabsorption. Serologic testing for celiac disease was negative, and the patient's age and ethnic background made celiac disease less likely. A previous history of strongyloidiasis also suggested possible autoinfection. Upon examination, strongyloides larvae were found in stool samples, and endoscopic studies confirmed extensive intestinal involvement, consistent with hyperinfection syndrome."
