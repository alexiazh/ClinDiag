        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pulmonary anthracosilicosis was confirmed through bronchoscopy with transbronchial fine needle aspirate, revealing macrophages in aggregates containing abundant anthracotic pigment and birefringent silica. These findings, along with the patient's history of living in Southeast Asia and his respiratory symptoms, supported the diagnosis."
