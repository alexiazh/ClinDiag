        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Fetal hydantoin syndrome is supported by the mother's history of daily phenytoin use during pregnancy, leading to the observation of multiple dysmorphic features in the neonate including microcephaly, hypertelorism, complete cleft lip and palate, and other anomalies consistent with the syndrome. Additionally, the neonate's critical condition at birth and subsequent expiration further indicate the effects of potential teratogenic exposure."
