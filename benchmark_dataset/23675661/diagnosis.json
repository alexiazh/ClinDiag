        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation of fever, confusion, and altered mental status, coupled with the acute nature of the symptoms, raised suspicion for an infection. Initial treatment for bacterial infections showed no improvement, leading to consideration of viral causes, particularly given the patient's exposure history and symptoms consistent with West Nile virus infection. CSF analysis demonstrated findings consistent with viral meningoencephalitis, specifically the positive IgM for West Nile virus, confirming the diagnosis."
