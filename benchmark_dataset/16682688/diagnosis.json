        "differential_diagnosis": "idiopathic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SCDC)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of copper deficient myeloneuropathy was made based on the patient's history of partial gastrectomy leading to malabsorption, symptoms of progressive neuropathy, anemia, and confirmed copper deficiency through serum and urine tests. Initial presentations of idiopathic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy evolved to include profound gait ataxia and other symptoms consistent with myeloneuropathy, prompting further investigation and ultimately leading to the diagnosis."
