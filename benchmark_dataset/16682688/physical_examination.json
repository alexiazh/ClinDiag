            "relevant_findings": "Cranial nerves were normal. Mild gait ataxia observed. Wasted right abductor pollicis brevis and dorsal interossei of both hands. Tone was normal; no fasciculations. Mild weakness bilaterally in shoulder abduction, APB, finger abduction, hip flexion, knee flexion, and dorsiflexion of the ankle. Impaired left heel-shin testing. All reflexes present except for right ankle jerk. Left plantar reflex flexor, right equivocal. Stocking and glove light touch and pinprick impairment to mid-calf/wrist. Proprioception impaired at the toes; vibration sense intact. General examination unremarkable.",
            "changes_over_time": "Progression noted; profound gait ataxia developed 1 month later. Numbness and painful dysesthesia spread to the umbilicus. Intention tremor of the left arm noted, no progression in upper limb weakness. Pyramidal weakness of the legs observed and bilateral heel shin ataxia reported. Pathologically brisk knee jerks and extensor plantar reflexes evident. Light touch and pinprick impairment extended to mid forearms and below umbilicus. Proprioception lost at toes and ankles."
