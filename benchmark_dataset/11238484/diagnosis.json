        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presentation of a mass lesion in the sella turcica with clinical features such as headaches, visual field defects, and biochemically elevated prolactin levels led to the suspicion of hypophysitis. Histological examination confirmed diffuse infiltration of the adenohypophysis by lymphocytes without evidence of giant cells or granulomas, consistent with primary hypophysitis."
