    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Combined Pituitary Hormonal Deficiency (CPHD) due to a novel LHX3 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a range of symptoms including poor feeding, persistent jaundice, micropenis, and poor weight gain, alongside laboratory findings of undetectable TSH, low free T4, low IGF-I, prolactin deficiency, and LH and FSH deficiency, all consistent with hypopituitarism. MRI indicated a hypointense lesion in the anterior pituitary, which suggested a microadenoma. The identification of a novel single-base-pair deletion in the LHX3 gene, confirmed through molecular analysis, supported the diagnosis of CPHD."
