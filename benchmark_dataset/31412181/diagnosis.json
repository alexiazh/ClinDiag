        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which is common in appendicitis. The physical exam revealed severe tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis indicative of inflammation. Imaging studies (non-contrast MRI) confirmed a dilated, thickened appendix consistent with acute appendicitis. The considerations of other potential causes were evaluated but found unlikely based on her history and examination findings."
