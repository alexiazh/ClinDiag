        "differential_diagnosis": "Serum sickness associated with acute hepatitis B virus infection.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, myalgias, arthritis, and rash, which were consistent with acute HBV infection, acquired from needle sharing in the context of injection drug use. Laboratory findings, including elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels and specific HBV markers (HBsAg positive, HBV DNA high levels, IgM anti-HBc reactive), supported this diagnosis. The patient's clinical presentation also included features resembling serum sickness, mediated by immune complexes formed in response to the HBV infection."
