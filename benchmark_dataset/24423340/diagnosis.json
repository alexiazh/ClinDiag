        "differential_diagnosis": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with intertriginous xanthomas and severe hypercholesterolemia, which were reversed by dietary modification and cholestyramine therapy. The family history suggested an autosomal recessive condition. Sitosterolemia was confirmed by the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in the ABCG5 gene and a striking elevation of sitosterol levels, indicative of increased absorption of plant sterols."
