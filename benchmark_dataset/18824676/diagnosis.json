        "final_diagnosis": "HHT-juvenile polyposis overlap syndrome with hypermanganesemia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's presentation of brain abscess-related seizures, a confirmed family history of epistaxis, and findings from imaging and biopsy that revealed the presence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal telangiectasia. The suspicion of HHT was confirmed by genetic analysis showing a mutation in the SMAD4 gene. Elevated serum manganese levels were consistent with the diagnosis due to hepatic shunting associated with HHT."
