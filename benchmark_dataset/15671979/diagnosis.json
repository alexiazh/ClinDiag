        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was confirmed by elevations in cardiac-specific creatinine kinase and cardiac troponin I levels. The patient's ECG showed inferior ST-segment elevations, and cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries, indicating that the likely mechanism was coronary vasospasm induced by the ingestion of pseudoephedrine."
