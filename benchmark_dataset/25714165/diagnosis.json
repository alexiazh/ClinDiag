        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The combination of synchronous oral and genital ulcers, rash, fever, myalgias, and cervical lymphadenopathy led to the consideration of Behçet’s disease. Clinical features, including mucocutaneous lesions, musculoskeletal involvement, and biopsy findings of small-vessel vasculitis, supported this diagnosis despite considerations of infectious and autoimmune causes due to the patient's history and symptoms."
