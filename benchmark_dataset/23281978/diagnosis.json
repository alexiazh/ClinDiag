        "final_diagnosis": "ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of STEMI was established based on the patient's presentation of severe sub-sternal chest pain with radiation to the left arm, nausea, and non-bilious vomiting, as well as the electrocardiogram findings showing ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V6, I, and aVL, which are consistent with an acute injury pattern in the anterolateral wall of the heart. The early presentation after pain onset and elevated troponin levels supported myocardial injury, confirming the STEMI diagnosis."
