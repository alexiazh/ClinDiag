Key findings included a negative culture for common viral and bacterial pathogens, as well as the unique evolution of the skin lesions and leukocytoclastic vasculitis observed in biopsy specimens. Although a concurrent A. haemolyticum infection was identified, it did not account for the polymorphic eruption, which aligned most closely with PLEVA, confirmed through clinical examination and histological findings."
