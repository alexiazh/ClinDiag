        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical symptoms of acromegaly and hypertension, elevated levels of GH and IGF-I, imaging findings of a pituitary mass invading the cavernous sinus, and confirmed through genetic analysis revealing a novel SDHD mutation with loss of heterozygosity in the GH-secreting adenoma."
