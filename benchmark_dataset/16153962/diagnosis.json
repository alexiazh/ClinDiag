        "final_diagnosis": "Transhiatal gastrobronchial fistula",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hemoptysis and showed nonbloody bilious secretions in the airways, which on further investigation revealed contrast flowing from the gastro-esophageal junction into the left pleural space through the hiatus. This, combined with the findings from bronchoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, supported the diagnosis of a gastrobronchial fistula as a complication of previous Nissen fundoplication."
