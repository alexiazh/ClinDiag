        "differential_diagnosis": "MEN 1, Carney complex, McCune-Albright syndrome, Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of very early-onset gigantism in the mother and her two sons, all having high levels of GH and prolactin. Evaluation revealed diffuse mammosomatotroph hyperplasia of the pituitary gland with no evidence of adenoma. The surgical excision of the pituitary led to normalization of hormone levels, supporting the diagnosis of hyperplasia rather than a lesion."
