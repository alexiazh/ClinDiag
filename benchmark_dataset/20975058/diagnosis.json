        "final_diagnosis": "Cold-induced sweating syndrome type 1 (CISS1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CISS1 was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and abnormal sweating patterns in response to temperature changes. Molecular studies revealed a pathogenic mutation in the CRLF1 gene, and skin biopsies showed an unusual pattern of sweat gland innervation with a lack of cholinergic fibers, consistent with CISS1."
