        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Fetal ultrasound findings showed short long bones and deformities such as bilateral club foot, which are characteristic of lethal skeletal dysplasia. Genetic analysis confirmed a homozygous mutation in the IMPAD1 gene, consistent with gPAPP type chondrodysplasia. Additional features noted in physical examination and imaging supported the diagnosis."
