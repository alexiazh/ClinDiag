CNS, spine, and abdominal viscera were normal. Estimated total lung volume was 24.8 mL with an O/E ratio of total lung volume of 1.6.",

            "findings": "Confirmed short long bones (< 4SD) with symmetrical involvement of proximal, middle, and distal bones, showing minimal bowing. Both distal humeri were deformed with a broad proximal end and minimal sclerosis. Clavicles appeared thick with an abrupt angle at the junction of the middle and outer third. Scapulae were stout and rounded. Bilateral subluxation of elbow joints was observed. Hands showed bilateral hitch-hiker thumb deformity with broad and short phalanges. Right great toe had excessive outward angulation. No fractures were noted. Skull bones were normal. Decreased vertebral height globally, small vertebral bodies in the lumbar region, and absent vertebral bodies in the upper cervical region were observed. A hemivertebra was present at D5. The thoracic cage was normal. The pelvic bones were horizontally oriented ileum.",

Whole exome sequencing using Agilent Sureselect clinical research exome V2 capture kit on Illumina HiSeq2000 identified a homozygous 2 bp duplication in exon 2 of the IMPAD1 gene causing a frameshift mutation (c.473_474dup; p.(Thr159*)) leading to premature truncation of the protein. The variant was absent in population databases (1000 genomes, gnomAD) and in-house databases. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.",
