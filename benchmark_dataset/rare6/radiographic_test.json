            "findings": "Confirmed short long bones (< 4SD) with symmetrical involvement of proximal, middle, and distal bones, showing minimal bowing. Both distal humeri were deformed with a broad proximal end and minimal sclerosis. Clavicles appeared thick with an abrupt angle at the junction of the middle and outer third. Scapulae were stout and rounded. Bilateral subluxation of elbow joints was observed. Hands showed bilateral hitch-hiker thumb deformity with broad and short phalanges. No fractures were noted. Skull bones were normal. Decreased vertebral height globally, small vertebral bodies in the lumbar region, and absent vertebral bodies in the upper cervical region were observed. A hemivertebra was present at D5. The thoracic cage was normal. The pelvic bones were horizontally oriented ileum. Growth cartilage showed focal cystic degenerative changes and separation of chondroblastic columns with vacuolated cytoplasm and occasional cytoplasmic inclusions.",
