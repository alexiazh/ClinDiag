        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a prolonged history of disseminated infection associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and had a family history of similar infections. Genetic sequencing identified a deletion in the IFNGR1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of dominant IFN-gR1 deficiency. Clinical findings included multiple infections due to atypical mycobacteria, supported by microbiological cultures."
