        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the notable association of ACTH deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in four patients, suggesting a potential disease association. Key evidence included repeated detection of undetectable ACTH and cortisol levels, symptomatic hypoglycemia, the presence of hypoplastic pituitary in three patients, and negative tests for pituitary autoantibodies."
