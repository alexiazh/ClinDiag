        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's ventricular tachycardia and QT interval prolongation recurred upon rechallenge with voriconazole, indicating a strong causal relationship. The QTc prolongation was concentration-independent and occurred in the absence of other arrhythmogenic factors, validated by a high score on Naranjoâ€™s Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, suggesting a direct link to voriconazole."
