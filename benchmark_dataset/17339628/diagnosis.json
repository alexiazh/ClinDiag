        "final_diagnosis": "Metronidazole-Induced Aseptic Meningitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced recurrent symptoms of headache, nausea, photophobia, and neck stiffness shortly after taking metronidazole as part of H. pylori eradication therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased protein, glucose, and leukocyte levels without identifying any pathogens. Symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of metronidazole and recurred with re-administration, which supports the diagnosis of metronidazole-induced aseptic meningitis."
