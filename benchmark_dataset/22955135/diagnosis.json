        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Three patients were found to have typical MRI findings of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, which included diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and brain sagging. None of the patients had significant neurologic symptoms, and findings were corroborated through MRI and CT myelography that showed extensive CSF leaks. The absence of significant clinical symptoms, combined with imaging results, led to the diagnosis."
