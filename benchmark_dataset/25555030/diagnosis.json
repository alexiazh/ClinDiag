        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden-onset headache, confusion, and vomiting, which were indicative of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Medical history revealed a previous SAH due to a left middle cerebral artery aneurysm, and imaging confirmed the presence of multiple cerebral aneurysms and advanced peripheral vascular disease. The patient exhibited typical RSS features alongside these vascular abnormalities, leading to the conclusion that her vascular issues may represent a new subtype of RSS."
