        "final_diagnosis": "MEGDEL syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of MEGDEL syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of progressive loss of abilities, subacute generalized dystonic features, and spastic tetraparesis. Further diagnostic tests, including a brain MRI showing bilateral basal ganglia lesions and genetic studies revealing biallelic pathogenic variants in the SERAC1 gene, corroborated the diagnosis."
