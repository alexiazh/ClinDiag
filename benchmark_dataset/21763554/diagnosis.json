        "differential_diagnosis": "desmoplastic melanoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor, dermatofibroma, perineurioma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Histopathological examination revealed acanthosis, basal hyperpigmentation, and a multinodular and fascicular array of slightly spindled to epithelioid cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for smooth muscle actin, NKI/C3, CD68, and CD10, but negativity for S100 protein and HMB-45, supporting the diagnosis of desmoplastic cellular neurothekeoma."
