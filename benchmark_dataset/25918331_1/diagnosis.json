        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of exercise-induced anaemia was supported by the observed symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnoea on exertion in the context of intensive physical training. Extensive work-ups ruled out common causes of iron deficiency anaemia, including gastrointestinal bleeding and coeliac disease. In cases where exercise was a significant factor, iron supplementation resolved the anaemia upon discontinuation of intensive training."
