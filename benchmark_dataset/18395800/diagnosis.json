        "final_diagnosis": "Retrobulbar optic nerve hemangioblastoma associated with von Hippel–Lindau disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Glioma, meningioma, schwannoma, hemangiopericytoma, lymphoma, metastasis, granulomatous disease, aneurysm, pituitary adenomas, retrobulbar neuritis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a brightly enhancing mass on MRI, signs of optic nerve compromise, and a history of von Hippel–Lindau disease, along with other CNS lesions and retinal hemangioblastomas, supported the diagnosis of retrobulbar hemangioblastomas. The tumors typically do not infiltrate the optic nerve but displace it, allowing for potential visual preservation post-surgery."
