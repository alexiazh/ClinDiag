        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Lhermitte-Duclos disease was supported by MRI findings which showed a T2 left cerebellar hemisphere pseudomass lesion without diffusion restriction or contrast enhancement, indicating a possible developmental lesion such as Lhermitte-Duclos disease. The absence of acute intracranial lesions on CT and negative EEG for epileptiform activity also played a role in ruling out other acute causes of the seizure."
