        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a combination of transient neurological symptoms (left-sided weakness and aphasia), episodes of sweating, nausea, and blurring of vision, as well as nocturnal palpitations which led to the consideration of atrial myxoma following echocardiographic and angiographic evaluations. The diagnosis was further supported by the surgical findings of a 3x4x2 cm pedunculated atrial myxoma."
