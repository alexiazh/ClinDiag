        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. W presented with symptoms suggestive of an upper respiratory tract infection, including cough, sore throat, and subjective fevers. The treating physician noted that her illness was likely viral based on the absence of significant respiratory examination findings and normal chest radiographs, which reduced the likelihood of pneumonia. Thus, the primary clinical impression was acute bronchitis."
