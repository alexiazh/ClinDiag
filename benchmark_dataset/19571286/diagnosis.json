        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was suggested by the patient's history of multiple fractures with minimal trauma, thin dental enamel, and associated clinical manifestations such as early hearing loss and easy bruising. Genetic testing showed mutations consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta, while functional testing of fibroblasts indicated decreased production of type 1 procollagen."
