        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. G exhibits a history of diminished libido and ED that began around the time of his wife's illness, suggesting possible psychological influences. Physical examination and lab results indicated borderline low free testosterone levels, leading to the consideration of both ED and hypogonadism as underlying issues. The treatment considerations revolve around their interconnectedness and the impact on Mr. G's quality of life."
