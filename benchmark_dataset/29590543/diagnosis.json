        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with painless unilateral testicular swelling and imaging indicated hypervascularity and hypoechoic regions consistent with an inflammatory process. Further imaging did not support a diagnosis of cancer, leading to a more likely diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis. The absence of symptoms typical of acute infectious processes and the partial response to previous antibiotic treatment suggested an underlying chronic infectious cause rather than malignancy."
