        "differential_diagnosis": "Metastatic thyroid cancer, acute inflammatory lung response",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Lung uptake on the radioiodine scan was found to be consistent with acute inflammatory changes from asthma, supported by the absence of morphological findings on CT and the unremarkable thyroglobulin levels. The patient's hypersensitivity to a dog allergen and the improvement of symptoms with corticosteroids and beta-2 agonists further confirmed the diagnosis of asthma exacerbation."
