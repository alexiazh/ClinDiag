        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. W has a long history of hormone replacement therapy due to severe menopausal symptoms following a hysterectomy and oophorectomy at age 40. Her recent attempts to taper off hormone therapy led to recurrent disabling hot flushes and a general feeling of malaise. Due to her strong family history of breast cancer and other risk factors, it was concluded that continuing hormone therapy posed greater risks than benefits, particularly given her symptomatic response during attempts to cease treatment."
