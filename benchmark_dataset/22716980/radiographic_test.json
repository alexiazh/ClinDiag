On the third day, changes consistent with pulmonary edema and increased cardiac silhouette; atelectasis seen on follow-up X-rays. On the fifth day after extubation, new hazy opacity in the right perihilar region. On the sixth day, increased opacification of lungs; bilateral pleural effusions observed 16 hours later. Overall, progressive worsening of atelectasis and pulmonary edema."
