        "final_diagnosis": "Spinal arachnoid cyst",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of spinal arachnoid cyst was established after imaging studies indicated a hyperintense extradural mass compressing the sacral nerve roots and causing paroxysmal headaches, elevated intracranial pressure, and intermittent bilateral optic-disk edema. The presence of papilledema and the correlation of symtomatology suggested that the cyst contributed to transient elevations in intracranial pressure."
