        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's genetic analysis revealed the G11778A mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with LHON. MRI showed abnormal signal intensity in areas consistent with basal ganglia involvement, and the clinical presentation included progressive multisystem neurodegeneration and acute neurologic dysfunction, which further supported the diagnosis of LHON."
