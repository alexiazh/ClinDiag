        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of right-sided abdominal pain, jaundice, leukocytosis, and elevated aminotransferase levels suggested a hepatobiliary disorder. Imaging studies, including ultrasonography and MRCP, revealed findings consistent with acute cholecystitis. The history of hemolysis and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration provided clues to hereditary spherocytosis, which was confirmed post-surgery with identification of pigment gallstones."
