        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through hormonal studies showing elevated 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione with undetectable plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous deletion hybrid gene combining elements of CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, leading to impaired expression in the adrenal zona fasciculata, resulting in the observed clinical features."
