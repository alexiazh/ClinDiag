        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical and histopathologic findings in the patient, his sister, and father are consistent with keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD), characterized by cicatricial alopecia and extensive keratosis pilaris. The hereditary pattern observed, along with the histological results showing perifollicular fibrosis and inflammatory infiltrates, supports this diagnosis."
