        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was supported by the patient's history of recurrent myxomas, the identification of a new intracardiac tumor in the left ventricle via MRI and echocardiography, and histopathologic examination confirming the tumor as a myxoma. The presence of other features associated with Carney complex, such as spotty pigmentation and endocrine hyperactivity, further reinforced the diagnosis."
