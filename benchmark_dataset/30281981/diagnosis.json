        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute trichinosis was supported by the patient's exposure to raw boar meat, the presence of myalgias, dyspnea, fever, and marked eosinophilia, as well as similar symptoms presented by other individuals in the same family following the same dietary exposure. The clinical findings, including elevated troponin levels and respiratory symptoms, correlated with the known manifestations of trichinosis, particularly during its parenteral phase."
