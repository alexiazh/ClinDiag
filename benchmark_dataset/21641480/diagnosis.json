        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of high protein concentration and lymphocyte count in CSF, along with a positive VDRL test, indicated an unexpected diagnosis of neurosyphilis. The patient's clinical signs, including bilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness and sensory symptoms, initially suggested Guillain-Barré syndrome, but the CSF analysis and the response to treatment pointed towards neurosyphilis."
