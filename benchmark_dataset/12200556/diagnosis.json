        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's age of onset, clinical presentation including seizures and visual disturbances (cherry-red spots), and the presence of membrane-bound curvilinear bodies in muscle biopsy. The absence of significant peripheral nerve involvement and normal cerebrospinal fluid protein levels helped rule out other potential diagnoses."
