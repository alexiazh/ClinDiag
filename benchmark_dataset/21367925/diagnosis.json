        "final_diagnosis": "Transient congenital hypothyroidism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with elevated TSH and an enlarged thyroid gland at neonatal screening. Genetic analysis revealed a missense mutation in the DUOXA2 gene resulting in complete loss-of-function, along with a deletion encompassing DUOX2, DUOXA2, and DUOXA1. Despite having only one functional maturation factor (DUOXA1), the child displayed transient congenital hypothyroidism, indicating redundancy in the DUOX/DUOXA system."
