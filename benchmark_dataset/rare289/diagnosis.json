        "final_diagnosis": "Multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical findings of fixed dilated pupils, absence of iris development, arteriolar tortuosity in the fundus examination, and insufficient growth of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles observed via anterior optical coherence tomography. Additionally, diagnostic imaging revealed significant vascular abnormalities, and genetic testing confirmed a heterozygous mutation in the ACTA2 gene, which is associated with smooth muscle dysfunction."
