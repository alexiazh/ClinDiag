    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic strongyloidiasis, acute schistosomiasis, acute larval migration (Loefflerâ€™s syndrome), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndromes",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The combination of marked peripheral eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE, chronic cough, and significant travel history suggested a diagnosis of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Although other conditions such as chronic strongyloidiasis and various eosinophilic disorders were considered, the patient's symptom profile and test results were most consistent with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, particularly given the history of travel to regions endemic for lymphatic filariasis."
