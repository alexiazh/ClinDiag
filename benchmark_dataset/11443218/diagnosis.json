        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of FNDI was based on the presence of excessive thirst, excessive urine production, and failure to thrive in children. Genetic analysis confirmed the NP85 Cys3Gly mutation in the VP prohormone gene, suggesting a defect leading to reduced vasopressin production."
