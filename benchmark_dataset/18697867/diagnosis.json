        "final_diagnosis": "Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe undermasculinization, perineal hypospadias, micropenis, and a bifid scrotum, which are characteristic features of PAIS. Despite having normal androgen binding, high-dose androgen treatment failed to elicit a response, confirming androgen resistance. Genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation (Arg629Trp) in the hinge region of the androgen receptor (AR), which disrupted the N/C-terminal interaction critical for AR function, thus supporting the diagnosis of PAIS."
