        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was determined through a process of ruling out various potential causes of stillbirth, including maternal conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hemoglobinopathy which were found to be unlikely based on clinical findings. The patient's history of low-level group B streptococci identified in urine in early pregnancy raised concerns for its role in the fetal death. The autopsy showed abundant group B streptococcus in fetal tissue, confirming an intrauterine infection."
