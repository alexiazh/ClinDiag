        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of a longitudinal vaginal septum was supported by the presence of a complete vaginal septum, cervical septum, and a septum inside the uterus, which were confirmed through hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Pelvic MRI findings of a normal-sized uterus with two uterine cavities separated by a low T2 signal septum also contributed to the diagnosis."
