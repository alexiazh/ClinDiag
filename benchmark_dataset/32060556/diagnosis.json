        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of biallelic loss-of-function variants in TBC1D32 via whole genome sequencing in affected patients. Phenotypic features included pituitary hormone deficiencies, absent anterior pituitary, and associated craniofacial dysmorphisms. The gene is implicated in Sonic hedgehog signaling, and its expression was confirmed in critical brain regions during development."
