        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of recurrent acute otitis, vomiting, irritability, and severe hyperammonemia. Genetic analysis identified two novel heterozygous mutations in the SLC25A15 gene, which were predicted to be detrimental to protein function. Treatment with sodium benzoate and dietary restrictions effectively normalized plasma ammonia levels, correlating with clinical improvement."
