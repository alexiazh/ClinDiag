        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and profound eosinophilia, alongside a significantly elevated IgE level. A high CD4:CD8 ratio and skin biopsies indicated atypical lymphoid proliferation, consistent with Sézary syndrome. The absence of a detectable T-cell clone, despite the high CD4 count, complicated the diagnosis but ultimately supported the conclusion of an evolving Sézary syndrome."
