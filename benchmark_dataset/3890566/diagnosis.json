        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed an abrupt manic episode associated with captopril use and the abrupt withdrawal of pargyline and propranolol, followed by a depressive episode. She had no prior psychiatric history, but a family history of depression was noted. The case aligns with reports linking certain medications to mood elevation and mania, particularly post-medication withdrawal."
