        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The siblings presented with combined peripheral nervous system and CNS involvement, with significant clinical findings including progressive weakness, hyporeflexia, and cranial nerve deficits. Genetic testing revealed homozygous mutations in the SLC52A2 gene, supporting a diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome type 2. Other potential diagnoses, such as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and mitochondrial disorders, were considered but ruled out based on further testing."
