        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe trismus (mouth opening of only 0.5 cm) following surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the palate, combined with severe periodontitis and submucous fibrosis. Surgical release alleviated the primary cause, but rehabilitation was essential to maintain jaw mobility, leading to the recommendation of a novel mouth-opening device."
