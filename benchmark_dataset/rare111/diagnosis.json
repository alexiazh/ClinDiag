        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included dyspnea, fever, cough, and hemoptysis, with diagnostic imaging showing opacification in the right upper lobe. Cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, supported by the inclusion of elevated procalcitonin levels and clinical deterioration leading to respiratory and metabolic acidosis."
