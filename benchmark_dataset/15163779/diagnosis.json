        "final_diagnosis": "Pulmonary embolism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity, recent ankle fracture, and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis as indicated by ultrasound. Rapid bedside echocardiography showed dilatation of the right ventricle, which is highly specific to acute pulmonary embolism. The prompt administration of thrombolytics led to the restoration of circulation and stabilization of blood pressure within a short time."
