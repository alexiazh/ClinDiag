        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia was supported by the presence of multicystic kidneys, severe oligohydramnios, consistent ultrasounds indicating enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts, enlarged pancreas with cysts, and echogenic liver. Genetic testing revealed pathogenic mutations in the NPHP3 gene, which are associated with renal dysplasia. Clinical symptoms included respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and significant oliguria, aligning with the diagnosis."
