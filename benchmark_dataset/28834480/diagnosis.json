        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's immunosuppression due to prior treatments for dermatomyositis and the presence of clinical signs such as persistent fever, hypoxemia, and imaging findings of ground-glass opacities. Diagnostic testing indicated high-level CMV viremia, which is indicative of CMV pneumonitis, particularly in the context of her immunocompromised state. The negative results of other relevant tests decreased the likelihood of these alternative diagnoses."
