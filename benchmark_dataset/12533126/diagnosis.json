        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. J has a long history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with symptoms not controlled initially by ranitidine but well controlled by omeprazole. An endoscopy in 1996 revealed Barrett esophagus with a mildly dysplastic gland. Subsequent biopsies have shown Barrett esophagus without dysplasia. Her risk of esophageal cancer is considered low, being no more than 0.5% per year, and current endoscopies have shown no dysplasia."
