        "final_diagnosis": "Right aortic arch",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of right aortic arch was supported by imaging findings from a chest radiograph and a CT thoracic angiogram, which revealed a right-sided aorta with three branches and the absence of the left subclavian artery. The presence of a right-sided tracheal bronchus and compression of the right main bronchus were also noted. The clinical presentation of episodic cough and breathlessness, along with the physical examination findings of tachypnea and feeble left radial pulse, further contextualized the diagnosis."
