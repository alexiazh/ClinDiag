        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of bilateral scapholunate dissociation was supported by radiographic findings of scapholunate gapping bilaterally, without any significant antecedent trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, or congenital ligamentous laxity noted in the patients. The natural history of the condition appeared to be benign, particularly when there was no presence of dorsal intercalated segment instability deformity."
