        "final_diagnosis": "Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PAVM was supported by CT coronary angiography which identified a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation within the lingula, along with peripheral saline contrast-enhanced echocardiography showing prominent bubbles in the left heart chambers indicating a fast pulmonary transit time due to extra-cardiac shunting. The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnoea and chest tightness, along with the evidence of a right-to-left shunt, substantiated the diagnosis."
