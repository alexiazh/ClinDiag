        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Fabry's disease was confirmed by measuring the deficiency of /H9251-galactosidase activity in leucocyte extracts, which was deficient in the boy and intermediate in the mother. Mutation analysis revealed a novel mutation (C56S) in both the boy and the mother, supporting the diagnosis."
