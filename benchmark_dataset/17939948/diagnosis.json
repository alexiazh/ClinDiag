        "final_diagnosis": "malignant acanthosis nigricans associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and adenocarcinoma of the prostate",
        "differential_diagnosis": "hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of florid cutaneous papillomatosis, generalized pruritus, and the specific skin findings alongside positive biopsies for SCC of the lung and adenocarcinoma of the prostate led to the diagnosis of malignant acanthosis nigricans. Hypothyroidism was ruled out as a cause after treatment, and it was considered unlikely that it contributed to the condition."
