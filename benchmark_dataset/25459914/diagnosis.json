        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of FGD in the siblings was supported by the identification of compound heterozygous mutations in the NNT gene: a novel heterozygous variant (p.Arg71*) leading to a premature stop codon, and a 4-bp duplication causing pseudoexon activation. Both genetic changes were linked to the observed clinical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, including hyperpigmentation and hypoglycemia, along with hormone levels indicative of adrenal dysfunction."
