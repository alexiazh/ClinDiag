        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through metagenomic sequencing which identified Powassan virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and was further corroborated by serologic testing 40 days post-admission. Key evidence included the presence of Powassan virus detected in CSF and the patient's clinical presentation, including symptoms of severe encephalitis without identifiable alternative causes despite extensive testing."
