        "final_diagnosis": "Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type 1 (PHA1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of autosomal dominant PHA1 was confirmed through the identification of a novel heterozygous mutation (c488C >G, S163X) in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) gene. The patient presented with elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, as well as clinical symptoms of salt wasting and failure to thrive. Despite the father's identical mutation, he was clinically asymptomatic, suggesting interindividual clinical heterogeneity."
