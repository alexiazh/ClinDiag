        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant presented with signs of respiratory distress, including a progressive cough, nasal congestion, and decreased interest in nursing. The chest radiograph revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, and diagnostic evaluation confirmed the presence of rhinovirus. Additionally, iatrogenic gastric insufflation was identified as impairing ventilation, necessitating the use of a supraglottic airway for effective management."
