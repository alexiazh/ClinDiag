        "differential_diagnosis": "Myocardial infarction and sepsis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening renal function, mental-status changes, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypotension, and evidence of a myocardial infarction. Key considerations included the radiographic abnormalities in the lungs and renal allograft, as well as the presence of gram-positive cocci grown in blood cultures. Imaging studies suggested infections in the lungs and kidneys. A core needle biopsy revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with coccidioides spherules, confirming the diagnosis of disseminated coccidioidomycosis."
