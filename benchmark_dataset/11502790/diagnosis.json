        "final_diagnosis": "Pheochromocytoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was supported by elevated levels of plasma normetanephrine, metanephrine, and epinephrine, along with increased 24-hour urinary excretion of epinephrine and metanephrine. Clinical signs such as episodes of palpitations and hypertension also indicated the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Novel localization techniques, including vena caval sampling and PET scanning, were used to confirm the presence of the tumor in the right adrenal surgical bed despite negative conventional imaging."
