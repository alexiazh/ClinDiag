        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was made after the patient showed no improvement with beta-interferon treatment initially thought to be multiple sclerosis. Imaging studies including F-18 FDG and F-18 FLT PET/CT revealed multiple F-18 FDG-avid lymphadenopathies, while the biopsy confirmed chronic non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation compatible with sarcoidosis."
