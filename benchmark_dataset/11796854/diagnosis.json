        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with significant ocular findings including bilateral episcleral vessel dilatation, neovascularization, choroidal masses, serous retinal detachment, and a history of vaginal bleeding. These symptoms, alongside elevated serum CA-125 and an enlarged uterus, pointed towards a systemic cancer. The diagnosis of bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation was confirmed as a paraneoplastic syndrome correlated with uterine carcinoma."
