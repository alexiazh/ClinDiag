        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Fabry disease was confirmed by significantly decreased activity of alpha-galactosidase A (a-gal A) in the patient's cultured peripheral white blood cells, showing less than 1% of the mean activity of normal control specimens. The patient's clinical symptoms, including painful neuropathy, proteinuria, and characteristic skin lesions (angiokeratomas), alongside family history, supported the diagnosis."
