        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of composite lymphoma was supported by various findings, including the presence of scattered lymphoma cells in peripheral blood, the diffusely hypercellular bone marrow with small lymphocyte infiltration, and immunohistochemical positivity for CD20, CD5, and CD23, along with a significant Ki-67 index indicating high cellular proliferation. Additionally, imaging showed lymphadenopathy and intestinal wall thickening, corroborating the diagnosis."
