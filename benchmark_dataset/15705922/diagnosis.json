        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of multiple follicles despite very low estradiol levels, elevated inhibin B levels, and elevated LH and FSH levels indicate ovarian dysfunction attributed to autoimmune oophoritis. The detection of adrenal cortical antibodies and antibodies to 21-hydroxylase further supports this diagnosis."
