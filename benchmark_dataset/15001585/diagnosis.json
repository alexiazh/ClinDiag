        "final_diagnosis": "Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Leydig cell hypoplasia, 5α-reductase deficiency, 17α-hydroxylase deficiency, androgen insensitivity",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical features including microphallus, hypospadias, undervirilization, and family history pointed towards PAIS. The clinical and hormonal profile was complicated by acute stress due to myocardial infarction and chronic corticosteroid therapy, which induced transient hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Molecular analysis confirmed a novel mutation in the androgen receptor. Follow-up testing demonstrated recovery of gonadotropin levels post-stress, supportive of the overall diagnosis."
