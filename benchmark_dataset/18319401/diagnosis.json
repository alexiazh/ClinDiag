        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was made based on the patientâ€™s history of recurrent abdominal pain since age 10, with multiple hospitalizations for flares. ERCPs demonstrated pancreatic duct abnormalities, including dilation and irregularity, consistent with chronic pancreatitis. Despite normal amylase and lipase levels, the identified pancreatic stones during ERCP confirmed the complication of the chronic pancreatitis."
