        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A novel deletion in the long noncoding RNA RMST was identified in the patient, which is believed to play a critical role in GnRH neuronal development and puberty. The patient's clinical features included hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, which are characteristic of Kallmann Syndrome. Genetic testing demonstrated a chromosomal translocation affecting RMST without any other known mutations associated with Kallmann Syndrome."
