        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome was supported by the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, peripheral edema, and hyperlipidemia. The markedly elevated thyrotropin level and low free T4 level confirmed clinical hypothyroidism, but it was determined to be secondary to the nephrotic syndrome rather than independent hypothyroidism due to urinary loss of thyroid hormone. The renal biopsy findings of effacement of foot processes suggested minimal-change disease."
