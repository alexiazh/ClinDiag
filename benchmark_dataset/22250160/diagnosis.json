        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed recurrent stress cardiomyopathy after taking Sudafed PE, presenting symptoms similar to a prior incident where psychological stress was identified as the trigger. Cardiac evaluations showed normal coronary arteries but significant left ventricular dysfunction associated with the medication use, suggesting a possible drug-induced mechanism."
