        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) was established based on echocardiographic findings, which included a significantly dilated right atrium and right ventricle, right ventricular eccentric hypertrophy, and inadequate response to nitric oxide during the 31-week gestation examination. Clinical presentation with severe dyspnea, dilated neck veins, and lower limb edema, alongside follow-up examinations over time confirming right-sided heart dilation, further supported the diagnosis."
