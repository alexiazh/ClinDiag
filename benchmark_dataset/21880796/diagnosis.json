    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Isolated adrenal insufficiency caused by a partially inactivating mutation of the CYP11A1 gene (p.R451W)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, familial glucocorticoid deficiency, adrenal hypoplasia congenita",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of isolated adrenal insufficiency was established based on clinical presentations, including recurrent vomiting and electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia). Additionally, decreased adrenal steroid levels and an adrenal crisis confirmed the adrenal insufficiency. The genetic analysis revealed a homozygous mutation in the CYP11A1 gene, which correlated with the observed clinical features and hormone levels."
