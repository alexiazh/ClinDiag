        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The recurrence of corneal dystrophies after phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) was analyzed based on patient demographics and original disease types. The study noted that recurrence is closely associated with the original corneal pathology, with specific types linked to different recurrence intervals and symptomatology. For example, band keratopathy and anterior basement membrane dystrophy recurred earlier compared to other types. The use of RTVue optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy provided critical insights into the morphology and location of recurrent deposits associated with each type of corneal dystrophy."
