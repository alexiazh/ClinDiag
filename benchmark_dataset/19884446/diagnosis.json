        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presented cases clearly demonstrate bilateral idiopathic osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral head in various family members. No prior or subsequent changes consistent with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease were found. The patients showed no involvement of other joints and were of normal stature, which eliminates the likelihood of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia."
