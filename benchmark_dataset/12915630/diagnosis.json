        "differential_diagnosis": "Cushing syndrome, obesity-related cortisol elevation, carbamazepine interference",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients had elevated urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels by HPLC, but normal levels using RIA and HPLC-MS/MS. Other tests like late-night salivary cortisol and dexamethasone suppression tests were inconsistent with Cushing's syndrome. Investigation revealed that fenofibrate caused interference in the assays, leading to false elevations in UFC values when measured by HPLC."
