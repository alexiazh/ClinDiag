        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Epsteinâ€“Barr viral infection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Infectious mononucleosis, recurrent urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, diverticulitis, splenic abscess, splenic infarction",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, splenomegaly, and abdominal pain, and laboratory tests suggested a viral infection. Acute EBV infection was supported by presence of IgM antibodies against viral capsid antigen and detectable EBV nucleic acid. Other potential causes of her symptoms, including bacterial infections, were deemed less likely based on test results."
