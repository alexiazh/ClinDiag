        "final_diagnosis": "Glucokinase maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical history included insulin-treated gestational diabetes, negative pancreatic autoantibodies, and low insulin requirements during pregnancy, which made T1D unlikely. Persistent fasting hyperglycemia and identification of a GCK mutation (p.T206M) confirmed GCK-MODY."
