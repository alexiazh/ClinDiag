        "final_diagnosis": "Fabry's disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PRKAG2 deficiency, Danon's disease, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, metabolic storage disorders",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe biventricular hypertrophy and preexcitation, which were suggestive of Fabry's disease. Genetic testing confirmed a GLA mutation, and leukocyte Î±-galactosidase activity was markedly reduced, consistent with Fabry's disease. Other conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and metabolic disorders were considered but ruled out based on the patient's clinical presentation and specific findings."
