        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's recurrent hypoglycemia after fasting intervals, metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, characteristic doll-like facies, marked lactic acidosis, and substantial growth failure were consistent with glycogen storage disease type Ia. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis."
