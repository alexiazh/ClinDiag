        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on the patient's presentation of serositis, polyarthralgia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and the specific features of the rash. This constellation of symptoms was consistent with adult-onset Still's disease. Negative tests for antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor ruled out other rheumatologic diseases, and the presence of pharyngitis supported this diagnosis. The absence of bacterial infection and the clinical course despite antibiotic treatment further indicated that other infections could be ruled out."
