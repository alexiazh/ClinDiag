        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of chronic daily headache, jaw claudication, myalgia, and systemic symptoms, along with MRI findings of dural thickening and enhancement, indicated a suspicion for secondary headaches. The elevated opening pressure and lymphocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid further suggested a secondary cause. The temporal artery biopsy confirmed the presence of granulomatous inflammation characteristic of giant-cell arteritis, ruling out other considerations including Wegener’s granulomatosis and idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis."
