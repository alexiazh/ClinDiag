        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients presented with clinical signs consistent with disseminated infection, including mediastinal lymphadenopathy and positive serologic findings for Coccidioides. Genetic sequencing revealed a mutation in the IL-12 receptor b1, confirming a defect in the IL-12/IL-23/IFN-Î³ pathway, essential for controlling Coccidioides species."
