        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Neu-Laxova syndrome was supported by an extended genetic study revealing a pathogenic missense variant in the PSAT1 gene, along with the morphological ultrasound findings indicating severe intrauterine growth restriction and several fetal abnormalities. The parents were confirmed as carriers of the PSAT1 gene, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern."
