        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of branching fungal hyphae in vitreous cultures, which were identified as Aspergillus fumigatus, and the identification of this organism in cultures obtained from affected prosthetic valve tissues. The patient's symptoms, including multiple emboli and the progression of infection despite initial antifungal therapy, reinforced the diagnosis."
