        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of aortic arch interruption was supported by the significant discrepancy in blood pressure between the upper and lower extremities, feeble pulses in the lower extremities, and imaging findings from the CT-A, which showed complete discontinuity between the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta alongside extensive collateral circulation."
