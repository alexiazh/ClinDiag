        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of XRCC4 deficiency was based on the identification of a novel homozygous variant in the XRCC4 gene, which was associated with severe short stature, microcephaly, primary gonadal failure, early-onset metabolic syndrome, and a possible predisposition to tumors. Functional analysis showed a significant impairment in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair mechanism, corroborating the clinical findings."
