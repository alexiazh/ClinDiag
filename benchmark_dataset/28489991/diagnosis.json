        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included palpable purpura and monoarticular arthritis with prominent swelling in a young man, alongside a history of Crohn's disease and an upper respiratory infection. These features suggested a small-vessel vasculitis. The absence of specific symptoms (such as renal or pulmonary involvement) and negative tests for ANCA decreased the likelihood of other vasculitides. IgA vasculitis was favored due to the combination of symptoms and potential triggers, including the recent infection and TNF-Î± inhibitor use. Histopathological findings on skin biopsy confirmed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition."
