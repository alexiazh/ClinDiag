        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of mastitis was suggested by the bright red area on the breast that spread quickly, accompanied by a lump near the nipple and fever of 39Â°C. Previous occurrences of cracked and bleeding nipples further supported the diagnosis, despite the patient initially believing the issue to be a blocked duct. The symptoms rapidly improved after supportive care and herbal treatments, consistent with a diagnosis of mastitis rather than an abscess."
