        "differential_diagnosis": "composite pheochromocytoma-ganglioneuroma, adrenocortical carcinoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of adrenal ganglioneuroma was confirmed pathologically following unilateral adrenalectomy in all seven cases. Imaging features included nonenhanced attenuation of the lesions between 25 and 40 Hounsfield units, plus varying hormonal secretory activity in some patients. Notably, instances of elevated catecholamines were linked to composite tumors with pheochromocytoma, indicating that the ganglioneuroma was part of a mixed tumor in these cases. Histological examination revealed mature adrenal ganglioneuromas."
