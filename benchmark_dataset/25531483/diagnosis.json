        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of primary splenic angiosarcoma was reached due to the presence of multiple hepatic lesions, splenic lesions, and a mass effect in the skull associated with significant hemorrhage. Initial imaging and laboratory findings were suggestive of neoplastic or infectious origins. Infectious causes were ruled out based on negative results from extensive testing. A bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. Autopsy findings confirmed splenic angiosarcoma with extensive metastasis to the liver and bones, corroborated by characteristic imaging features of the lesions."
