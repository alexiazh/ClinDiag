        "differential_diagnosis": "Bacterial pneumonia, Pulmonary cryptococcosis, Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) was confirmed after significant decrease in immunoglobulins was noted, along with the evidence of Granulomatous Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease (GLILD). Initial treatments for presumed pneumonia did not improve the patient's condition, and further tests ruled out infections and secondary causes. The stabilization of respiratory status and improvement post high-dose steroid therapy also supported the diagnosis."
