    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Jansen Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia due to heterozygous H223R-PTH1R mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of radiographic findings including rickets-like metaphyseal changes, asymptomatic hypercalcemia despite low PTH levels, and the identification of the H223R mutation in all affected individuals. The distinctive skeletal abnormalities and the unusual occurrence of normal calcium levels in the affected mother despite the mutation were noted. This showed that overt hypercalcemia is not always evident in JMC, which aided in the establishment of the diagnosis during the patients' early evaluations."
