        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the detection of high levels of HHV-6 DNA and RNA, identification of HHV-6 integration at chromosome 22, and clinical symptoms consistent with HPS. The patient's X-SCID condition provided an avenue for the activation of ciHHV-6A, leading to severe clinical manifestations."
