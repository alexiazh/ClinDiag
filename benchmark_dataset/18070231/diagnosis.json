        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was made based on the clinical presentation of recurrent angio-oedema episodes associated with increased estrogen levels due to oral contraceptive use and pregnancy, while laboratory tests showed normal levels and function of C1INH and C4. The familial history of similar symptoms and the absence of response to corticosteroids and antihistamines further supported the diagnosis."
