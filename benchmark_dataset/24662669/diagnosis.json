        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by findings from 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning, which revealed focally increased 18F-FDG uptakes in the cervical esophagus and bilaterally in supraclavicular lymph nodes, leading to suspicion of esophageal cancer. This was further confirmed by endoscopic mucosal biopsy that diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion."
