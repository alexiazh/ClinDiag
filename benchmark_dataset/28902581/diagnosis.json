        "final_diagnosis": "Disseminated Mycobacterium genavense infection due to an underlying inborn error of interferon-Î³ immunity.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Lymphoma, disseminated mycobacterial disease (M. tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacterium), and immunodeficiency syndromes.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The child presented with pneumonia lasting over 4 months despite treatment and showed multi-organ involvement (lungs, spleen, lymph nodes). Findings such as acid-fast bacilli in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, maternal history of BCG disease, and a positive tuberculin skin test contributed to the suspicion of mycobacterial disease. Detection of M. genavense in the child and strong suspicion of an underlying immunodeficiency led to the diagnosis."
