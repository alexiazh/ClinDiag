        "final_diagnosis": "symptomatic mania related to phencyclidine abuse",
        "differential_diagnosis": "tardive dyskinesia, depressive neurosis, passive-dependent personality, catatonic schizophrenia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed manic-like symptoms following the use of phencyclidine, and his presentation was consistent with a manic episode. Symptoms persisted longer than expected relative to the drug's half-life and responded minimally to neuroleptics but improved significantly with ECT and subsequently lithium carbonate. The absence of prior psychiatric history and a return to baseline functioning after effective treatment supported the diagnosis of symptomatic mania."
