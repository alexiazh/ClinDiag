        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary hyperparathyroidism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The proband presented with moderate hypercalcemia, normal serum PTH levels, and a low calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio, leading to the identification of the R227Q mutation in the CASR gene, which segregated with affected family members. The symptoms were consistent with FBHH as opposed to primary hyperparathyroidism."
