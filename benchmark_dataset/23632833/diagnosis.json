        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. Jâ€™s loss of libido was correlated with her initiation of antipsychotic medication, particularly pimozide, which is known to elevate prolactin levels. The psychiatrist ruled out other factors such as depression, and the patient's libido concerns were discussed in the context of her marital relationship and medication effects. A switch to aripiprazole successfully lowered her prolactin levels and improved her sexual function, indicating that the high prolactin level due to antipsychotic treatment was a key factor in her sexual dysfunction."
