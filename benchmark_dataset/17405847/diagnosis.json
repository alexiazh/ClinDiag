        "final_diagnosis": "Primary Growth Hormone Insensitivity (GHI) due to compound heterozygous mutations of the Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR) gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of postnatal growth failure, elevated serum GH levels, low serum IGF-I levels, and the identification of two novel compound heterozygous mutations (C94S and H150Q) in the GHR gene, which were shown to impair GH signaling and gene expression."
