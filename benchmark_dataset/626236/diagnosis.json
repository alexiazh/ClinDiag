        "differential_diagnosis": "Schizophrenia, organic brain syndrome, hysterical dissociative state, pseudodementia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's psychiatric symptoms, including severe depression and cognitive impairment, prompted a neurological evaluation. Key findings included an abnormal skull X-ray indicating increased intracranial pressure. A CT scan revealed a large spherical mass occupying the third ventricle, which obstructed the lateral ventricles and was diagnosed as a colloid cyst rather than a tumor."
