    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Giant dissected pulmonary artery with external compression of the left main coronary artery due to pulmonary arterial hypertension",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on echocardiography findings of preserved left ventricular function but dilated right ventricle, heart catheterization confirming pulmonary arterial hypertension with high mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and imaging showing a massive aneurysm of the pulmonary arterial vasculature along with intimal flaps indicative of chronic dissection. The presentation of symptoms like angina and dyspnea alongside these findings led to the conclusion of the dissection and compression."
