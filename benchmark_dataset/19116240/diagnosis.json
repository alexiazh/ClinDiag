    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "P450scc deficiency due to novel homozygous L222P mutation in CYP11A1 gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Defect of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with ambiguous genitalia and adolescent-onset adrenal insufficiency, consistent with partial P450scc deficiency. Diagnostic workup, including hormonal profiling and mutational analysis, revealed a homozygous L222P mutation in CYP11A1, correlating with reduced enzymatic activity. Elevated ACTH levels and deficiencies in certain steroid hormones further supported the diagnosis."
