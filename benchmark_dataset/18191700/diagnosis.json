        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the laboratory finding of CD4 T lymphocytopenia (absolute CD4 T-cell level <300 cells/mmÂ³ or <20% of lymphocytes more than once), negative tests for known causes of T-cell depletion (including HIV), and the absence of defined immunodeficiency. The presence of multiple flat warts in the context of this immunological defect supported the diagnosis."
