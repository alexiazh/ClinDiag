        "differential_diagnosis": "Vasculitis, Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, Acute renal failure",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with weight loss, hematuria, hemoptysis, purpura, and polyneuropathy, which suggested a systemic disease. Laboratory findings included eosinophilia and positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. A renal biopsy showed segmental necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates consistent with vasculitis. The clinical findings were characteristic of Churg–Strauss syndrome, a small-to-medium vessel vasculitis associated with asthma, eosinophilia, and renal involvement."
