        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was established based on the patient's history of tuberous sclerosis, imaging findings of an enlarging SEGA causing hydrocephalus, and the presence of enhancing lesions in the spinal cord suggestive of drop metastases. The elevated Ki-67 labeling index in the tumor and the patient's rapid deterioration post-surgery also supported the diagnosis."
