        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of methanol toxicity was supported by the patientâ€™s occupational exposure to a mixture of propane and methanol, elevated methanol levels in serum, severe metabolic acidosis, and symptoms including nausea, headache, blurred vision, and respiratory distress. The absence of other volatile alcohols in tests ruled out alternative alcohol poisonings."
