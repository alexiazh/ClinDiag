        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Adamantinoma was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of swelling and discomfort in the leg, X-ray findings indicating a lytic expansile lesion with a narrow zone of transition, and histopathology results showing biphasic tumoral tissue with atypical cells. The absence of prior trauma and negative systemic investigations also contributed to the diagnosis."
