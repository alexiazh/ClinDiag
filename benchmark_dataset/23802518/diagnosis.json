    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Malaria, hyper-splenism, immune-mediated hemolysis, microangiopathy, infection",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with dark urine and signs of marked anemia. Laboratory evaluations showed a rapid drop in hemoglobin and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, indicating hemolysis. The Coombs' test was negative, ruling out immune-mediated hemolysis. Malaria was considered due to recent travel but confirmed negative. The patient's ancestry pointed towards G6PD deficiency as a potential cause of the acute hemolytic anemia, especially given the self-limiting nature of his condition."
