The proximal fallopian tubes filled promptly and were of normal thin, regular caliber, but the distal ampullary and infundibular portions were abnormally dilated and had multiple filling defects. Diverticular outpouchings in the ampullary and infundibular portions of the fallopian tubes were also seen. Lack of free spillage of contrast material into the peritoneal cavity indicated bilateral tubal occlusion.",
