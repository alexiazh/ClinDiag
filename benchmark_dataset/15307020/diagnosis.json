        "final_diagnosis": "Hepatopulmonary Syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) was made based on the patient presenting with hypoxemia, confirmed by a contrast-enhanced echocardiogram (bubble study) showing air bubbles in the left heart chambers after they appeared in the right heart chambers. There was no evidence of intrinsic cardiac or pulmonary disease, thus supporting the diagnosis of HPS due to chronic liver disease associated with HIV and HCV infections."
