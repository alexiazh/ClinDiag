        "differential_diagnosis": "Cellulitis, Erysipelas, Impetigo, Paronychia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with erythema, swelling of the left index finger, and marked lymphangitic streaking without a clear history of trauma or bites. This presentation, along with the lack of fever and the notable local adenopathy, supports the diagnosis of a CA-MRSA infection due to the commonality of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in such cases. Blood cultures were drawn due to the seriosity of the symptoms. The final diagnosis of MRSA was confirmed post-surgery from wound culture results."
