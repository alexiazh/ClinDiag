            "changes_over_time": "Initial postoperative MR images showed decompression of both optic nerves and residual disease. Follow-up MR images at 6 weeks showed marked resolution of the multiple skull base lesions. At 10 months postoperative follow-up, repeated MR imaging showed interval progression of enhancing lesions, especially in the posterior fossa. A follow-up MR image obtained 1 month later indicated resolution of the enhancing lesions again."
