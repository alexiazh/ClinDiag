        "differential_diagnosis": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis, sarcoidosis, infectious processes (tuberculoma), lymphoproliferative disorders, plasma cell granuloma, inflammatory pseudotumor",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease was confirmed through histopathological analysis showing a lesion composed of mostly histiocytes positive for S100 protein and CD68, as well as the presence of emperipolesis, which is characteristic of RDD. Imaging results also suggested multiple dural-based enhancing lesions consistent with RDD, similar to meningiomas."
