        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included high myopia, microspherophakia, ectopia lentis, pectus deformity, and osteoporosis, which led to the suspicion of homocystinuria. Testing showed markedly elevated homocysteine levels and genetic testing confirmed pathogenic mutations in the cystathionine β-synthase gene."
