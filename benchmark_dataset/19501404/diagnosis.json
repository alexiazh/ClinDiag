        "final_diagnosis": "DiGeorge syndrome and Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited classical features of DiGeorge syndrome, including micrognathia, cleft palate, retroglossoptosis, and significant ocular findings consistent with FEVR. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed a de novo microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.2, substantiating the diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. Mutation screening for known FEVR genes (LRP5 and FZD4) did not reveal abnormalities, indicating that a novel gene or mutation may be involved in the FEVR phenotype."
