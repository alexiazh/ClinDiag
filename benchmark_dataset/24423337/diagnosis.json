        "differential_diagnosis": "Pregnancy-associated osteoporosis (PLO)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of multiple thoracic vertebral fractures, severe osteoporosis demonstrated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Z-scores: L2â€“L4, -5.6 SD; femur neck, -3.9 SD), and the discovery of compound heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 gene, indicating an underlying genetic cause. The patient's family history of osteoporosis and related fractures reinforced the diagnosis."
