        "final_diagnosis": "Subjective visual disturbances due to sildenaﬁl administration",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited visual disturbances, specifically halos, a bluish tinge to vision, and increased light sensitivity, occurring 1 to 2 hours after sildenaﬁl ingestion. Electroretinogram testing indicated significant variations from baseline, with an increase in rod response (Vmax) and a decrease in K, consistent with the expected effects of the weak PDE-6 inhibition induced by sildenaﬁl."
