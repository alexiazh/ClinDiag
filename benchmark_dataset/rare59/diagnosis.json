        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of progressive gait difficulty, vertigo, and episodic diarrhea, combined with neurological examination findings of nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract signs, and proprioceptive defects. MRI findings indicating bilateral, symmetric hyperintense lesions in the dentate nuclei and deep cerebellar white matter, along with elevated cholestanol and 7-dehydrocholesterol levels in the plasma sterol profile and genetic testing confirming mutations in CYP27A1, were critical in affirming the diagnosis."
