        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of orthostatic intolerance syndrome was established based on postural sinus tachycardia that often approached 180 beats/min, palpitations, extreme lability of arterial blood pressure when standing, frequent syncope, and pronounced fatigue. Autonomic diagnostic evaluation revealed abnormal tilt-table examination results that reproduced the patient's symptoms, and elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations were observed."
