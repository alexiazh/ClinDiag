        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's recurrent wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath initially suggested asthma; however, the absence of confirmatory pulmonary-function testing and the normal results during tests indicated that asthma therapy was ineffective. The findings of normal pulmonary-function tests and direct fiberoptic laryngoscopy suggested that the source of wheezing might be related to tracheomalacia, which was ultimately confirmed through bronchoscopy that revealed significant airway collapse."
