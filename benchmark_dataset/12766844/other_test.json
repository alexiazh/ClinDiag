After 14 months, these values remained less than pretreatment levels in 2 of 3 children, and a sustained increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes was observed at a rate of 18 cells/mL per month.",
            "changes_over_time": "No clinically significant adverse events were noted. During the 14 months after the initiation of therapy, the children were seen fewer times for sick visits, and there were no documented CDC C3 opportunistic infections. The most recent evaluation after 26 months revealed regular school attendance and fewer missed days due to illness."
