        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with painful papules and nodules on the left side of her body, which were confirmed histologically as leiomyomas. The lesion distribution was compatible with type 2 segmental leiomyomatosis, and the patient's family history included cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas. Normal laboratory investigations and exclusion of occult neoplasms supported the diagnosis of Reed syndrome."
