        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Cowden syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical history of multiple tumors, including bilateral breast cancer and a cerebellar tumor, familial history of Cowden syndrome, and the identification of a likely pathogenic variant in the PTEN gene. Additionally, the presence of multifocal oral mucosal papillomatosis and the manifestation of other associated conditions aligned with the diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome."
