        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient was diagnosed with craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS) due to a heterozygote mutation in the EFNB1 gene c.429_430insT (p.Gly144TrpfsTer31), which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The presence of similar phenotypical features and the same mutation in the patient's mother supported the CFNS diagnosis."
