        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by the absence of measurable serum LH and testosterone levels, along with low FSH and inhibin B. Human CG stimulation increased serum testosterone, indicating hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in one case. Additionally, progressive involution of genitalia and the requirement for testosterone treatment to reintroduce male genital development were key findings."
