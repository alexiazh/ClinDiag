        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of primary cutaneous plasmacytosis was supported by the presence of multiple reddish-brown macules and papules, elevated globulin protein levels, and abnormal gamma globulin levels without monoclonal gammopathy. A skin biopsy revealed superficial plasma cell infiltration, and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of plasma cells, indicating a specific skin condition related to plasma cell dyscrasia."
