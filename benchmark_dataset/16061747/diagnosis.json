        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Romano-Ward Syndrome was confirmed through the observation of prolonged QT intervals in both the neonate and the mother, corroborated by molecular genetic testing that revealed identical mutations within the LQT1 locus. Additionally, fetal magnetocardiography demonstrated sinus bradycardia and prolonged QTc intervals."
