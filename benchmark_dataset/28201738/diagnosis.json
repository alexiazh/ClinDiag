        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Apolipoprotein C-II deficiency was supported by genetic analysis revealing a homozygous missense variant (R72T) in APOC2, which resulted in the absence of functional apoC-II activity and undetectable levels of apoC-II protein in the patientâ€™s plasma. This molecular finding distinguished it from lipoprotein lipase deficiency."
