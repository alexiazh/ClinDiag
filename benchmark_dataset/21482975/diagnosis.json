        "differential_diagnosis": "amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of severe heart failure, echoed by the echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 15%, alongside a lack of evidence for other potential causes (thyrotoxicosis, alcohol use) led to a presumption of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. The low suspicion for amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and sarcoidosis based on laboratory findings contributed to not performing an endomyocardial biopsy."
