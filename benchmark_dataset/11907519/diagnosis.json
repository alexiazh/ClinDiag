        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Vitiligo developed within 3 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sister who had extensive vitiligo. This supports the hypothesis of adoptive transfer of donor immunity. De novo development of vitiligo in a genetically predisposed patient and autoimmune phenomena associated with graft-versus-host disease cannot be completely excluded, but overall evidence suggests a strong link to the transplant."
