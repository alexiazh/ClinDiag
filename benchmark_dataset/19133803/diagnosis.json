        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the clinical presentation of a rapidly progressive encephalopathy following smallpox vaccination, supported by abnormal CSF findings including lymphocytic pleocytosis and positive IgM antibodies for orthopoxvirus, as well as MRI findings showing demyelination. The patient's significant improvement with early administration of IVIG, corticosteroids, and vaccinia immunoglobulin further supported the diagnosis."
