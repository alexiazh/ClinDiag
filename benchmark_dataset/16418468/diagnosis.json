        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. A has a long history of severe depression requiring hospitalization and demonstrates treatment resistance to various antidepressants. Despite her presentations of broad affect and humor, her complex history of childhood abuse and recurring physical symptoms complicate her diagnosis, suggesting underlying personality disorder elements. The absence of psychotic features also helps rule out psychotic disorders."
