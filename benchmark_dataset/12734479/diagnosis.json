        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited multiple basal cell carcinomas, jaw cysts, typical facies, palmoplantar pits, epidermal cysts, and intracranial calcifications, along with a confirmed diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the minor salivary glands. The combination of these features led to the diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome, particularly as it represents the first documented case concurrent with adenoid cystic carcinoma."
