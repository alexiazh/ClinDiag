        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Graves' disease was made based on the patient's clinical presentation of increased heart rate (105 bpm), symptoms of fatigue, palpitations, heat intolerance, increased appetite, decreased sleep, poor concentration, and laboratory findings including suppressed TSH (0.06 IU/ml) and elevated free T4 (2.25 ng/dl) and T3 (4.67 nmol/liter). The absence of severe ophthalmopathy supported the diagnosis, while the recurrence of symptoms after stopping methimazole indicated ongoing disease activity."
