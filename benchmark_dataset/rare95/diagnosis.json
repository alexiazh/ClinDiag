        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cone rod dystrophy was supported by the significant decrease in visual acuity, abnormalities in fundus examination showing retinal thinning and macular degeneration, and specific findings in enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography revealing foveal thinning. The abnormal flash full-field electroretinography results indicated dysfunction in photopic conditions, and genetic testing identified a pathogenic homozygous mutation in CDHR1."
