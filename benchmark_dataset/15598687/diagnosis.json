        "final_diagnosis": "Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism due to GPR54 Mutations",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with undetectable gonadotropins and micropenis at birth. Genetic testing revealed compound heterozygosity for two novel missense mutations (C223R and R297L) in the GPR54 gene, which are associated with loss-of-function mutations affecting the GnRH axis. The C223R variant demonstrated severely impaired signaling in vitro, supporting its role in the patient's clinical condition."
