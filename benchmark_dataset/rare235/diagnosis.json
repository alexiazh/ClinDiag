        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical presentations such as persistent splenomegaly, increasing thrombocytopenia, and specific histological findings from the spleen. Immunohistochemical profiling indicated abnormal T cells. The significant presence of TCRÎ³ rearrangement and abnormal cell characteristics corroborated the diagnosis of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma."
