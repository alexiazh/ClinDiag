        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia post-cesarean section. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, and erythema at the incision site, suggesting an acute abdomen. Imaging showed diffuse bowel distention and increased opacity in the pelvis. Potential causes included infection, with strong suspicion of an infection arising from the uterus or surgical site. Intraoperative findings of purulent fluid and necrosis were consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, and subsequent cultures confirmed group A streptococcal infection."
