        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by markedly elevated plasma pristanic acid levels, impaired pristanic acid oxidation in cultured skin fibroblasts, and identification of a homozygous mutation in the AMACR gene. Additionally, the patient exhibited recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections and anesthesia, which were consistent with energy metabolism defects."
