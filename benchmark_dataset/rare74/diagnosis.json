        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Schaaf-Yang syndrome was supported by clinical findings of obesity, intellectual disability, dysmorphism, advanced bone age, irregular menstrual cycles, and insulin resistance. Genetic testing revealed a novel pathogenic variant in the MAGEL2 gene, classified as 'Likely Pathogenic' according to ACMG criteria. No other variants that could explain her clinical presentation were identified."
