        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms consistent with thyroid-related mood disturbances shortly after being diagnosed with Graves' disease. The presence of both manic and depressive symptoms suggested pediatric bipolar disorder, but the psychiatric symptoms appeared soon after the onset of Graves' disease, indicating a possible causal relationship. The psychotic symptoms were likely secondary to severe mood disturbances, supporting the diagnosis of bipolar disorder due to another medical condition."
