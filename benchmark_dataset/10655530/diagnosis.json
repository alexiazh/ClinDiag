        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hyper-IgM syndrome was made after identifying significant clinical features, including a history of severe infections in a sibling, abnormal liver function tests, and a liver biopsy suggesting sclerosing cholangitis. Genetic testing confirmed a deletion in the CD40 ligand gene, establishing the diagnosis."
