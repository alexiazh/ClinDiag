        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome was supported by the clinical history of progressive visual loss, the presence of corneal posterior embryotoxon, iris abnormalities, and a family history of an autosomal dominant condition affecting the newborn son. Additionally, the advanced glaucomatous damage and facial dysmorphism indicated a syndromic association."
