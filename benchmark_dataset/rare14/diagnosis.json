        "final_diagnosis": "Progressive sensorineural hearing loss-hypertrophic cardiomyopathy syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of progressive exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance, family history of consanguinity, physical examination findings of bradycardia and multiple craniofacial dysmorphisms, and significant diagnostic test results including echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and findings on cardiac MRI. Additionally, metabolic testing suggested underlying metabolic dysfunction, culminating in the identification of a pathogenic mutation in the BCS1L gene."
