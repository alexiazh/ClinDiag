        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The proband presented with growth retardation, low serum selenium level, and thyroid test abnormalities. The sequencing of the SBP2 gene revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation that produces an early stop codon (R128X), and in vitro analysis indicated that mutant isoforms capable of generating functional domains could be synthesized. The relatively mild phenotype was attributed to this partial preservation of SBP2 function."
