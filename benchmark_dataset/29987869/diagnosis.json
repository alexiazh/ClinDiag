        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A missense mutation (K330E) in the plasminogen (PLG) gene was identified in 4 members of two unrelated families with HAEnCI. The criteria for HAEnCI included recurrent angioedema, normal C1 inhibitor activity, absence of urticaria history, and lack of response to antihistamines and corticosteroids. Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of the K330E mutation, which was absent in 100 healthy controls."
