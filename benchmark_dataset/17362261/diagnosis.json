        "final_diagnosis": "Latex-fruit syndrome with cross-reactivity to turnip and zucchini",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by positive skin prick tests to latex and certain fruits and vegetables, along with specific IgE testing. Inhibition studies showed significant cross-reactivity between latex and both turnip and zucchini for the first time, thus confirming the latex-fruit syndrome."
