        "history_of_present_illness": "The twin sisters, who were premature, developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to hyaline membrane disease. They initially experienced asthma with exacerbations related to viral infections in infancy. At age 6, they developed respiratory allergies to various aeroallergens, leading to symptoms of seasonal rhinitis and persistent atopic dermatitis. Their asthma remained poorly controlled despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-2 mimetics, resulting in over 10 hospitalizations between ages 4 and 8.",
