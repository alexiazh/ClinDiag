        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was supported by the detection of an identical 212delC mutation in the CEBPA gene across three affected family members. This gene mutation is implicated in the pathogenesis of AML and was not found in unaffected family members, indicating a hereditary pattern. Additionally, the specific AML subtype (M2Eo) manifested without other identifiable cytogenetic abnormalities further confirmed the diagnosis."
