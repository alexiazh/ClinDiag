        "final_diagnosis": "type 2 diabetes mellitus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. M has a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes for 6 years with an HbA1c value of 7.4%, despite being on maximum doses of glyburide, metformin, and rosiglitazone. Her clinical course reflects the natural history of type 2 diabetes where patients often require additional medications over time to maintain glycemic control. She exhibits abdominal obesity and hypertension, which are common in this condition. There are no microvascular complications evident as of now, suggesting that while she has diabetes, it has not yet led to damage requiring additional interventions."
