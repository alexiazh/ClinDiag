        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus was isolated from the patient's stool, with the viral capsid protein VP1 region diverging from the vaccine strain by 12.3%. This indicates that the infection likely occurred 11.9 years earlier when her child received the oral poliovirus vaccine. The patient's history of long-standing common variable immunodeficiency contributed to prolonged poliovirus replication, ultimately leading to paralysis and subsequent death."
