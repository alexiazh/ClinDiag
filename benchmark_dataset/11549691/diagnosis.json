        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-Î²-hydroxylase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia was supported by the identification of a chimeric CYP11B2/CYP11B1 gene due to an unequal crossover event and the presence of significant clinical symptoms including high blood pressure and sexual precocity. Specific biochemical findings also indicated elevated serum levels of steroid precursors consistent with this condition."
