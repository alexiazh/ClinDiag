        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PMDS was based on the clinical presentation of two brothers with persistent Müllerian duct derivatives and the identification of two novel mutations in the anti-Müllerian hormone type II receptor gene (AMHR-II). The family history indicated autosomal recessive inheritance. Surgical findings and hormonal assays further supported the diagnosis."
