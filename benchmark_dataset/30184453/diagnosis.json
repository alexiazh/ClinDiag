Extensive diagnostic testing showed negative results for infectious and rheumatologic causes. The combination of worsening symptoms (B symptoms), cytopenia, splenomegaly, high serum LDH levels, and ultimately positive skin biopsy results supported the diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma, which is characterized by its rarity and specific symptoms."
