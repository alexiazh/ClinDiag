        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 10 at codon position 431, leading to the substitution of Gly431 with Ser, which resulted in constitutive activation of both the Gs/adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C pathways, evident from functional characterization of the mutation."
