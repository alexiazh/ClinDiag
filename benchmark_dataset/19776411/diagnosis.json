        "final_diagnosis": "Transitional-cell carcinoma of the left ureter (AJCC TNM pathological stage pT1N0Mx).",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Transitional-cell carcinoma of the right renal pelvis (AJCC TNM pathological stage pT3NxMx).",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited malignant cells consistent with transitional-cell carcinoma in urine cytology. Imaging studies, including CT and MRI, showed circumferential thickening of the left proximal ureter, indicating the presence of a tumor. The cancer was further confirmed by post-operative pathology, which revealed transitional-cell carcinoma in situ and invasion of the lamina propria without muscularis invasion, indicating a pathological stage of pT1."
