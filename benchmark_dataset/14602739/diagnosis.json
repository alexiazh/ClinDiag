        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The initial diagnosis of hypercalcemia due to malignancy was reconsidered based on biochemical data showing long-standing mild hypercalcemia with normal PTH levels and a significantly low urinary calcium excretion. Genetic analysis confirmed familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia through the identification of a novel loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor."
