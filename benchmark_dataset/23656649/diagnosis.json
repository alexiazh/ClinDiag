        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's vaginal bleeding and biopsy results indicated a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm suggestive of carcinosarcoma. The age of the patient and the findings from the ultrasound and pathological examination supported the diagnosis, aligning with statistics that indicate a high prevalence of cancer in postmenopausal women with similar symptoms."
