            "findings": "Successful resection of large retinal hemangioblastomas in 3 VHL cases; loss of heterozygosity at the VHL allele locus in the VHL retinal hemangioblastomas. High levels of transcript and protein were found for VEGF and CXCR4, while low levels of CXCL12 mRNA were expressed in retinal hemangioblastomas associated with VHL disease.",
            "changes_over_time": "Three months post-operation, vision improved in Case 1 from 0.3 (20/70) to 0.5 (20/40). In Case 3, the number of hard macular exudates decreased and vision improved from LP to 0.2 (20/100) three months post-surgery. The vision in Case 4 improved from 0.6 (20/33) to 0.9 (20/25) three months after surgery."
