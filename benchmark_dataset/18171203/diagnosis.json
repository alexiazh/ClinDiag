        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was supported by the patient's liver biopsy results showing panlobular hepatitis, positive antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody titers, and a history of autoimmune disease. Additionally, the patient's ALT levels showed a prompt decrease following corticosteroid treatment, further confirming the diagnosis."
