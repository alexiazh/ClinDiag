        "final_diagnosis": "Graves’ disease with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypokalemia due to renal or non-renal causes, Primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, glucocorticoid excess, other genetic disorders causing hypokalemia.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's profound weakness and hypokalemia were rapidly resolved with potassium chloride supplementation, indicating that the weakness was due to transcellular potassium shift rather than total-body potassium depletion. The presence of hyperthyroidism indicated by low thyrotropin and elevated free thyroxine levels, along with additional features such as weight loss and gynecomastia, supported the diagnosis of Graves’ disease. His episodes of muscle weakness were consistent with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis."
