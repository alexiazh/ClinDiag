        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital syphilis was supported by the reactive T. pallidum hemagglutination assay and the symptomatic presentation of the infant, including inadequate weight gain, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal abnormalities indicative of possible osteomyelitis. Additionally, the mother's negative syphilis screening during pregnancy heightens the suspicion of congenital transmission."
