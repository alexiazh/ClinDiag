        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with rapidly progressive ataxia, cognitive impairment, and myoclonus. The differential diagnosis included conditions that could cause ataxia, particularly those affecting the cerebellum. Neuroimaging showed characteristic patterns associated with the cerebellar form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. CSF analysis revealed elevated total tau and positive 14-3-3 protein assays, confirming rapid neuronal damage, consistent with the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The absence of response to immunosuppressive therapy further supported this diagnosis."
