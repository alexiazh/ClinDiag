        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation, including a long history of intermittent abdominal symptoms, and positive interferon-Î³ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, combined with the presence of multiple granulomas in biopsy specimens suggested a high likelihood of intestinal tuberculosis. The findings were more consistent with tuberculous enteritis than with other diagnoses considered due to the overlap in clinical manifestations with Crohn's disease and the characteristic imaging findings."
