        "final_diagnosis": "Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with multifocal MTC at age 14, prompting genetic analysis of the RET protooncogene. Initial analysis did not reveal a mutation; however, further investigation led to the discovery of a novel missense mutation (arginine to proline at codon 912 in exon 16) associated with hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. The patient's early age of onset and the familial nature of the disease support the diagnosis."
