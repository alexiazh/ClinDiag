        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with changes in mental status, headaches, and evidence of inflammation. MRI revealed multiple lesions in the brain, particularly in the corpus callosum, and he reported symptoms of retinal vascular occlusion and hearing loss, which were clinically confirmed. Extensive testing ruled out infections and rheumatologic conditions, allowing for the consideration of Susac's syndrome, characterized by the involvement of the brain, retina, and hearing."
