        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC) was based on clinical features such as short trunk, severe short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and characteristics seen in radiography including generalized platyspondyly. The patient exhibited prepubertal development and experienced psychomotor delays, including mental retardation. Radiological and biochemical investigations ruled out mucopolysaccharidosis and supported the identification of DMC syndrome."
