        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of brucellosis was supported by the patient's travel history to the Middle East, clinical manifestations suggestive of brucellosis, positive blood cultures identifying Brucella melitensis, and the observation of a nonspecific febrile syndrome without localizing signs. The organism was initially misidentified as Moraxella phenylpyruvica, which is often confused with Brucella. Differentiating the actual pathogenic agent through culture and serology confirmed the diagnosis."
