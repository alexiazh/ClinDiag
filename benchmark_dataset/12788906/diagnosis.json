        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome was supported by the presence of congenital sensorineural hearing loss and the identification of the V138F mutation in the PDS gene, which is associated with the condition. The presence of elevated serum TSH levels and the common haplotype associated with V138F in the affected individuals from German families further substantiated the diagnosis."
