        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by imaging findings of an irregular mass with calcifications, core biopsy revealing infiltrating ductal carcinoma (grade 2 of 3), and histopathological examination confirming metastatic tumor cells in the sentinel lymph node without extracapsular extension. The tumor was positive for estrogen-receptor protein, and no vascular invasion was noted."
