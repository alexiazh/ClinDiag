        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis was supported by the patient's echocardiographic findings: a peak gradient of 97 mm Hg and a calculated aortic valve area of 0.7 cmÂ², indicative of severe stenosis, along with a history of mild shortness of breath during exertion. Despite mild symptoms, the decision was made to monitor him clinically due to his excellent functional capacity and preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction."
