        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 4-year-old boy, presented with rapid growth, coarse facial features, and elevated serum levels of prolactin and insulin-like growth factor-1, along with a homogenous bulky pituitary gland observed on MRI. Biopsy showed hyperplastic pituitary tissue. Although genetic testing of peripheral DNA was negative for GPR101 duplication, DNA from pituitary tissue revealed a somatic mosaicism for GPR101 duplication, confirming the diagnosis of X-LAG."
