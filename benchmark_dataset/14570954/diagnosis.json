        "final_diagnosis": "persistent atrial fibrillation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. B has a 2-year history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has progressed into persistent atrial fibrillation. Key findings include multiple symptomatic episodes confirmed by a loop recorder and a mildly enlarged left atrium observed on echocardiogram. The increase in frequency of her episodes and the clinical context of her management decisions also support this diagnosis."
