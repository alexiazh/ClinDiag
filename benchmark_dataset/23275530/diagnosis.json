        "final_diagnosis": "Homozygous Leptin Receptor Mutation due to Uniparental Disomy of Chromosome 1",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on the identification of a new homozygous LEPR sequence frameshift mutation resulting from paternal isodisomy. This mutation was predicted to generate a truncated LEPR protein, causing severe early-onset obesity and delayed puberty. The patient's clinical presentation aligned with known characteristics of leptin receptor mutations, including extreme hyperphagia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."
