        "final_diagnosis": "Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis due to metastatic lung adenocarcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary lung cancer, opportunistic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), central nervous system infections, stroke",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The combination of pulmonary symptoms, dysarthria, and neurologic findings suggested a process involving both the lungs and the central nervous system. Chest imaging revealed a consolidation in the right lower lobe, and CSF analysis indicated elevated protein levels and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Cytologic analysis showed neoplastic cells with markers indicating an epithelial origin consistent with lung cancer, leading to the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis."
