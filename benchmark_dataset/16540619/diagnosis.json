        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The imaging characteristics of the central nervous system abnormality suggest a neoplasm rather than a vascular process. In light of the patient's long history of Crohn's disease and immunosuppressive therapy, lymphoma was considered a likely diagnosis. The presence of atypical lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid and the findings from the inguinal mass supported the diagnosis of lymphoma, with flow cytometry indicating EBV positivity."
