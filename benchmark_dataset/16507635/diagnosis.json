        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on the identification of a novel 825delC mutation in the TITF1/NKX2.1 gene, which was associated with the phenotypic presentation of congenital hypothyroidism and choreoathetosis in the two sisters. The mutation resulted in a nonfunctional protein that exhibited dominant-negative effects on the transcriptional activity of the wild-type TTF1 protein, which was supported by functional studies."
