        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's left hemiparesis suggested a right hemisphere stroke, which was confirmed by MRI showing frontal infarction in the anterior cerebral artery territory. Detection of a right carotid focus with focal uptake on 18F-FDG PET/CT indicated unstable plaque, which aligns with the patient's risk factors and subsequent neurological symptoms."
