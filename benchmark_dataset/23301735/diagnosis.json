        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of potential exposure to bats, severe hydrophobia, agitation, paresthesias, and rapid clinical deterioration suggested rabies as the most likely diagnosis. MRI findings supported the suspicion, with abnormal signal hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. Though rabies is rare in Massachusetts, the distinct clinical presentation, including severe anxiety related to liquid intake, was indicative of rabies. Testing confirmed the presence of rabies virus antigen."
