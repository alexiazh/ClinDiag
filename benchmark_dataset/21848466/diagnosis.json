        "final_diagnosis": "extramedullary hematopoiesis and splenomegaly due to thalassemia intermedia, possibly hemoglobin E thalassemia or hemoglobin H disease",

        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with paraspinal masses, moderate anemia with profound microcytosis, and splenomegaly. Imaging studies and biopsy results revealed features consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis. The degree of splenomegaly and paraspinal masses, along with her history of anemia, suggested thalassemia intermedia. Genetic testing revealed deletion mutations in Î±-globin genes consistent with hemoglobin H disease."
