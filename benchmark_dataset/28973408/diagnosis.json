        "final_diagnosis": "Carney complex (CNC)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Carney complex was based on the identification of a de novo large gene deletion affecting the PRKAR1A gene at chromosome 17q24.2 in both siblings. The proband exhibited clinical features including acromegaly, cardiac myxoma, and a malignant melanotic schwannian tumor, which align with the typical presentation of CNC. Additionally, the sister presented with acromegaly and a pituitary microadenoma. Both siblings had multiple neoplasms and typical pigmented lesions, further supporting the diagnosis."
