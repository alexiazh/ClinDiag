    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) due to mutation in MCT8",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, elevated free T3 levels, and a detected missense mutation in the MCT8 gene. The clinical phenotype was consistent with AHDS, a condition characterized by resistance to thyroid hormone, wherein high T3 levels were noted even with malnutrition. Treatment with propylthiouracil and levothyroxine was required to normalize serum TSH levels, further supporting the diagnosis of MCT8 mutation causing TH resistance."
