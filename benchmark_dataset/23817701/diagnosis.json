        "differential_diagnosis": "Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), Lyme disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Borrelia miyamotoi infection was supported by the identification of B. miyamotoi DNA in the peripheral blood of both patients using molecular diagnostic assays, alongside an absence of evidence for Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection or other common tick-borne pathogens. The patients did not respond rapidly to doxycycline, which is characteristic of HGA, suggesting a different etiology."
