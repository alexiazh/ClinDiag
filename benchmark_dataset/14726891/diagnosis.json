        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by a series of clinical and pathological findings including the identification of a pigmented lesion of the vulva, positive biopsy results for malignant melanoma, the presence of metastasis indicated by a lung nodule and abdominal masses, and the development of diffuse cutaneous melanosis. The occurrence of placental metastasis with a healthy infant, despite the aggressive nature of the melanoma during pregnancy, further emphasized the poor prognosis associated with vulvar melanoma."
