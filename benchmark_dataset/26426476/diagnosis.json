        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with primary hyperparathyroidism and had elevated serum calcium and PTH levels. Initial imaging was nonlocalizing, but repeated sestamibi imaging showed asymmetric uptake in the left submandibular gland, which was confirmed by CT imaging. A reoperation revealed an adenoma at the left level 2A, leading to a decrease in PTH levels after excision."
