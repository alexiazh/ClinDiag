        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis type 3 was supported by the patient's clinical history of progressive neurological decline, biochemical analyses showing very low Î²-galactosidase activity consistent with GM1 gangliosidosis, and genetic testing revealing pathogenic variants in the GLB1 gene. The MRI findings and the specific clinical presentation also reinforced the diagnosis."
