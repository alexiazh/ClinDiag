        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by an open-lung biopsy that revealed large blood vessels with abnormal walls and small nodular collections of thin-walled capillaries. Initial considerations included interstitial lung disease and vasculitis, but pulmonary-capillary hemangiomatosis was confirmed as distinct due to specific pathological findings, including the absence of venous thrombosis and occlusion. The patient's clinical progression and specific imaging findings, such as abnormal perfusion and changes seen on CT scans, reinforced this diagnosis."
