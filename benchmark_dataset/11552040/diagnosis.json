        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CTLN2 was based on the clinical presentation of adult-onset recurrent encephalopathy, significant hyperammonemia, and brain edema, along with laboratory findings including high serum levels of citrulline and low argininosuccinate synthetase activity in liver biopsy. Elevated serum pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) was noted, which is believed to be associated with the disease."
