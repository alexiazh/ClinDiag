        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of TUBB3 E410K syndrome was supported by the identification of a heterozygous de novo c.1228G/H11022A mutation in the TUBB3 gene, which manifested clinically in the proband and her sons with features such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, facial weakness, anosmia, and developmental delays. The proband also exhibited normal sexual development and reproductive function, which was atypical compared to previously reported cases."
