    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation due to a missense mutation in the Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Receptor (IGF1R)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by identification of a heterozygous G3148 3A nucleotide substitution in the IGF1R gene, which resulted in the E1050K mutation affecting the intracellular kinase domain. This mutation was correlated with reduced autophosphorylation and downstream signaling in dermal fibroblasts, demonstrating its pathogenic impact on IGF-I signaling essential for normal growth."
