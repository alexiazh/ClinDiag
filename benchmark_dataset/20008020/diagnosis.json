        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hormone resistance and features of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), leading to an initial diagnosis of PHP-Ia. Molecular studies revealed an intragenic GNAS deletion that included the upstream differentially methylated exon A/B, causing an apparent loss of GNAS imprinting typical of PHP-Ib. Comparative genome hybridization identified the deletion, which was inherited from the mother, who is mosaic for the mutation. This explains the phenotypic variability between the mother and daughter."
