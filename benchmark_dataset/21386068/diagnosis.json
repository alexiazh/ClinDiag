        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. W presented with an unprovoked episode of VTE, as indicated by multiple emboli in bilateral pulmonary arteries and a thrombosis in the left peroneal vein. A hypercoagulable workup was negative, and her elevated D-dimer level after discontinuing anticoagulation indicated a higher risk for recurrence. Given her history of pulmonary embolism and the associated risks of bleeding with anticoagulation, ongoing management considerations were discussed."
