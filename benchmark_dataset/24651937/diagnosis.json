        "final_diagnosis": "Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited transient episodes of bradycardia and hypotension following preoperative embolization of bilateral carotid body tumors. This hemodynamic instability was indicative of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, confirmed by the significant cardiovascular complications encountered during surgery, which necessitated the placement of a temporary pacemaker. The mixed subtype of carotid sinus hypersensitivity was noted as bradycardia and hypotension in response to embolization."
