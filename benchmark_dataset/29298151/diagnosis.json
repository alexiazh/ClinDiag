        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gastrinoma was supported by elevated serum gastrin levels, low gastric pH, imaging results showing a hepatic mass, and biopsy results indicating strong expression of gastrin. The persistent symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain coupled with the mass were key in considering this diagnosis."
