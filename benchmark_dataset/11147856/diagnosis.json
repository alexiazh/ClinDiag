        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of anterior sacral meningocele was supported by imaging findings revealed during postoperative MR imaging, which showed an intrasacral meningocele communicating with an anterior sacral meningocele. Additionally, the absence of other findings during laparotomy for ovarian cyst further pointed towards ASM. Surgical exploration confirmed the presence of the meningocele with associated structures."
