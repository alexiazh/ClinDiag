        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's recurrent syncope was attributed to the severe pectus excavatum leading to expiratory compression of the inferior vena cava, as demonstrated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) that showed marked compression and flow restriction. Position-dependent syncope was confirmed through tilt-table testing, where the patient employed maneuvers to avoid syncope by shifting the sternum away from the IVC."
