        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The child's earlier febrile urinary tract infection was due to pansensitive Escherichia coli, with subsequent assessment revealing persistent bilateral grade III vesicoureteral reflux despite normal kidney function and anatomy on imaging studies. She has remained free of urinary tract infections for the past year, indicating stability of her condition. The clinical consensus suggests observation may be preferable due to her lack of complications."
