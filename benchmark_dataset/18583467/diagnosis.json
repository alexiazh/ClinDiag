        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Autosomal Dominant Hypoparathyroidism (AD-HP) was supported by identification of novel heterozygous mutations in the GCMB gene, which displayed dominant-negative effects on parathyroid hormone secretion. Clinical presentations such as hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were observed in family members, confirming the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern."
