Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (septal thickness 17 mm, posterior wall thickness 12 mm). Late-peaking LVOT gradient of 129 mm Hg, increasing to 185 mm Hg with Valsalva maneuver. Moderate to severe posterolaterally directed mitral regurgitation due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Tricuspid aortic valve with thickening and calcification of leaflets, resulting in restricted aortic opening (peak gradient 44 mm Hg, mean gradient 27 mm Hg, valve area 1.4 cmÂ²). Left atrial enlargement.",
