        "final_diagnosis": "Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Aortic Stenosis (AS), Hypertensive Cardiomyopathy, Isolated Upper Septal Hypertrophy (USH)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion, a known symptom of HOCM, particularly due to mechanisms such as diastolic heart failure, LVOT obstruction, and mitral regurgitation. History of HCM and echocardiographic findings confirmed asymmetrical septal hypertrophy and substantial LVOT gradients, supporting the diagnosis. Additional echocardiography also indicated the presence of moderate AS. Cardiac catheterization further confirmed dynamic LVOT obstruction, while histopathological findings from surgery indicated myocyte disarray consistent with HCM."
