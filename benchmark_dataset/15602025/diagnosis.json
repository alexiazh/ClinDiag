        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Histologic examination of the resected tumor showed a cellular tumor invading dura and bone, with findings consistent with plasmacytoma. The absence of plasma-cell myeloma in the bone marrow biopsy and the isolation of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis. Imaging findings were suggestive of meningioma, but the pathology revealed it to be a plasma-cell tumor."
