        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a long history of alendronate therapy and developed severe thigh pain with bilateral stress fractures confirmed by MRI, alongside evidence of low vitamin D and suppressed bone turnover. The initiation of teriparatide therapy resulted in significant improvement and healing of the fractures, suggesting its primary role in the patient's recovery."
