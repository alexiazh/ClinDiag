        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of fibroblastic rheumatism was established based on clinical features (cutaneous nodules and polyarthritis) and histopathological findings from biopsy specimens, which showed a fibroblastic proliferation associated with a collagenous stroma and absence of elastic fibers. The presence of specific clinical symptoms and the exclusion of other similar conditions through laboratory testing and histology were critical to confirming the diagnosis."
