        "final_diagnosis": "Necrotizing lymphadenitis due to Treponema pallidum (syphilis)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Mycobacterial infection, cat scratch disease, lymphoma, other infections (e.g., bacterial, viral), granulomatous disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, night sweats, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Imaging revealed enlarged lymph nodes with necrosis, raising suspicion for mycobacterial infection and malignancy. After a lymph node biopsy, histological findings suggested necrotizing lymphadenitis. Positive serological tests and subsequent immunohistochemical staining for Treponema pallidum confirmed syphilis as the diagnosis."
