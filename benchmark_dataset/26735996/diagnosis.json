        "final_diagnosis": "Mixed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis secondary to primary Sjögren’s syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of worsening dyspnea, fatigue, and new skin rash, combined with laboratory findings of hematuria, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and renal biopsy results showing glomerulonephritis with a membranoproliferative pattern, support the diagnosis of mixed cryoglobulinemia. The elevated rheumatoid factor and the patient's established history of Sjögren’s syndrome indicate that the renal impairment is likely related to this condition."
