        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on the detection of lymphocytosis with a monoclonal population of T cells and the finding of proviral integration at the LMO-2 locus, associated with aberrant gene expression. The progression of lymphocyte counts and the development of hepatosplenomegaly further substantiated the diagnosis."
