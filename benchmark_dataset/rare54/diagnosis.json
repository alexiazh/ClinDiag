        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) was established through flow cytometry after ruling out other conditions. Key findings included severe anemia, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and renal biopsy showing acute tubular necrosis with hemosiderin deposition, which suggested hemolysis. The negative results for potential autoimmune and nephrotoxic causes also supported the diagnosis of PNH."
