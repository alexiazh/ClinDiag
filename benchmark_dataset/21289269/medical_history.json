        "history_of_present_illness": "Symptoms began at 1 week of age with elevated blood ionized calcium, serum PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and low calcium excretion. Initial treatment with iv fluids and furosemide did not improve hypercalcemia. At 2 weeks old, pamidronate treatment led to hypocalcemia and further increase in PTH levels but hypercalcemia recurred within a week. Introduction of a single oral dose of cinacalcet at 3 weeks led to decreased PTH levels and normalization of ionized calcium within days.",
        "past_medical_history": "The infant was born at 35 weeks gestational age, weighing 1955 g with low birth metrics for length and head circumference. No relevant past medical conditions were specified.",
