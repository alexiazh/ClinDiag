        "final_diagnosis": "Neonatal Hyperparathyroidism with a Heterozygous Calcium-Sensing Receptor (CASR) R185Q Mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a heterozygous mutation (R185Q) in the CASR gene, elevated blood ionized calcium, elevated serum PTH, and low calcium excretion in the infant. The clinical presentation, including hypercalcemia and inappropriately high PTH levels despite normal family calcium levels, affirmed the diagnosis of neonatal hyperparathyroidism."
