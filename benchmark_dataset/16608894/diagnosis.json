    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "autosomal dominant hypocalcemia due to activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hypocalcemia at 3 weeks of age, and genetic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation (L727Q) in the CASR gene. This mutation was associated with severe hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria, leading to successful treatment with recombinant human PTH(1â€“34). The patient's symptoms improved, urinary calcium excretion decreased significantly, and no serious hypocalcemic episodes occurred during PTH treatment."
