        "differential_diagnosis": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Intrauterine growth retardation",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Case 1 had a deletion of the IGF1R gene linked to growth failure and recurrent hypoglycemia. Case 2 had three copies of the IGF1R gene and displayed tall stature, with distinguishing features suggesting a correlation between IGF1R gene copy number and cell proliferation rate."
