        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. B presented with a long history of illicit prescription opioid use and alcohol dependence, characterized by significant cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and depressive symptoms. These patterns, along with her ambivalence about alcohol abstinence, were key in establishing the diagnosis. The situational anxiety after nearly being caught stealing prescription pads prompted her to seek treatment."
