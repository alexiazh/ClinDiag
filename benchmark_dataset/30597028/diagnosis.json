        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, following a distal spleno-pancreatectomy for insulinoma, continued to experience hypoglycemic episodes attributed to residual nesidioblastosis. Despite treatment adjustments including high-dose diazoxide and octreotide, hypoglycemia persisted. Further diagnostic imaging indicated an insulinoma relapse, and subsequent subtotal pancreatectomy resolved the hypoglycemic events over 9 months."
