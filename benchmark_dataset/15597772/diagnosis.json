        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma was established based on histopathological findings of marked cellular pleomorphism, mitotic activity, capsular invasion, and probable vascular space invasion. The patient also presented with elevated serum levels of calcium and PTH, and imaging studies revealed a right frontal mass consistent with metastatic carcinoma that displayed identical histological features to the primary PTC."
