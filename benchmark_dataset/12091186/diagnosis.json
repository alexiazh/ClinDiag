        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. A met all DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, including symptoms such as hallucinations, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms present for over one month. His history and examination ruled out other disorders like schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, developmental disorders, and mood disorders. The subtype of schizophrenia was noted as catatonic due to predominant features. Additionally, Mr. A's low intellectual functioning and history of developmental issues supported the diagnosis of pfropfschizophrenia."
