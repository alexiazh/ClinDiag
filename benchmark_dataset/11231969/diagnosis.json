        "final_diagnosis": "systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe neonatal-onset salt wasting, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated plasma aldosterone, and renin activity. His symptoms and laboratory findings were compatible with systemic PHA1, leading to molecular analysis that identified two novel mutations in the gsubunit gene of ENaC, confirming the diagnosis."
