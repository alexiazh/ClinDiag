        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Diagnosis was supported by the presence of activating mutations in the LH receptor gene, elevated testosterone, inhibin B levels, and the clinical features of precocious puberty observed in the affected boys. Testis biopsies showed normal germ cell maturation and Sertoli cell function despite low gonadotropin levels."
