        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, back pain, and a history of exposure to unpasteurized camel's milk, warranting consideration of brucellosis. Imaging studies showed significant changes at the L5â€“S1 level indicative of possible infection, notably the presence of fluid in the disk space and paravertebral soft tissue inflammation. Serologic studies confirmed Brucella infection, aligning with her geographic exposure and clinical symptoms."
