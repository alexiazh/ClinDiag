        "final_diagnosis": "pulmonary nodular lymphoid hyperplasia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "metastases, malignant lymphoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of extrathoracic malignancy, elevated serum interleukin-2 receptor levels, and the temporal growth of pulmonary lesions raised suspicion for malignancy. However, histopathological analysis after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical biopsy revealed a circumscribed mass of lymphoid tissue with numerous reactive germinal centers, indicative of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. Definitive diagnosis required tissue confirmation due to overlapping features with other conditions such as MALT lymphoma and plasmacytoma."
