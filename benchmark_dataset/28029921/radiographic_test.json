            "findings": "Macrocephaly with marked enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles, consistent with hydrocephalus. Abnormal hyperintense signal along the margins of the lateral ventricles indicative of transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting acute-to-subacute hydrocephalus. Focal stenosis of the superior aspect of the cerebral aqueduct.",
            "changes_over_time": "After endoscopic third ventriculostomy, the size of the ventricles had decreased, previously seen transependymal edema resolved, and the sulci were better defined due to decreased mass effect."
