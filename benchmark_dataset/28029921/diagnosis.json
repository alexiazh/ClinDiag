        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included recurrent vomiting, developmental regression, and macrocephaly, which led to the suspicion of increased intracranial pressure, possibly due to hydrocephalus. MRI findings confirmed marked enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles consistent with hydrocephalus."
