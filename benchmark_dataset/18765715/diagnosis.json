        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of exogenous lipoid pneumonia was established after the patient, who had a history of smoking crack cocaine mixed with petroleum jelly, was evaluated for progressively worsening dyspnea and underwent bronchoscopy followed by a wedge biopsy. Histopathology showed lipid vacuoles and inflammation characteristic of lipoid pneumonia. Other potential diagnoses, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, were considered but ruled out due to the lack of supporting evidence."
