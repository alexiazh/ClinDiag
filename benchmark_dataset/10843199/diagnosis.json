        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of generalized cortisol resistance (CR) was made based on the clinical and biochemical evidence of resistance to glucocorticoids, characterized by an intact diurnal rhythm of serum cortisol at elevated levels, insufficient suppression of serum cortisol following administration of dexamethasone, and variable degrees of androgen overproduction, all in the absence of clinical signs of Cushing's syndrome."
