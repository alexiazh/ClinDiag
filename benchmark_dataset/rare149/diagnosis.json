        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Campomelic dysplasia was supported by clinical presentation of ambiguous genitalia, skeletal dysplasia, and associated findings including limb malformations and developmental delays. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant in the SOX9 gene, which is associated with Campomelic dysplasia, and findings of a 46XY karyotype with positive SRY gene indicated a male phenotype despite female external genitalia."
