        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a lumbosacral myelomeningocele and signs indicative of spinal cord tethering. Neurological imaging, including craniospinal MRI, revealed both a lumbosacral myelomeningocele and a thoracic Type I split cord malformation characterized by a proximally situated osseous septum. The surgical approach required careful consideration due to the unique positioning of the osseous septum, which impacted the surgical strategy."
