        "differential_diagnosis": "limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), myotonic dystrophy (DM1 and DM2), facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), myofibrillar myopathy (MFM), autosomal dominant Emery-Dreyfus muscular dystrophy (EDMD), autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, congenital myopathy, distal myopathy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's progressive symmetrical proximal limb weakness, family history of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, muscle biopsy features, and muscle EMG findings suggest myopathy rather than a motor neuron disorder. The lack of bulbar symptoms and the patient's long-standing weakness point away from inflammatory myopathy or acquired conditions. The presence of winged scapulae, cardiac abnormalities, and the specific elevation in CK and muscle biopsy characteristics led to myofibrillar myopathy being the most likely diagnosis."
