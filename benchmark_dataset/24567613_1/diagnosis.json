        "final_diagnosis": "Very late perforation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator lead",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of elevated ventricular pacing thresholds, reduced sensing amplitude, and a CT scan revealing the perforation of the ICD lead into the pericardium, which resulted in a large pericardial effusion. The gradual progression of symptoms and electrical characteristics of the lead also underscored the diagnosis."
