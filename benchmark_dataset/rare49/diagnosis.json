        "final_diagnosis": "Amniotic fluid embolism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism was supported by the acute onset of severe hypotension, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and respiratory distress shortly after the cesarean section, along with the presence of skin rashes. The rapid deterioration of the patient's condition and the lack of abnormalities in further diagnostic tests (echocardiogram and coagulation testing) also contributed to the diagnosis."
