        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a painful, shallow tongue ulcer of 3 weeks' duration accompanied by acute cervical lymphadenopathy and blisters on the legs. A biopsy of the lesion revealed features suggestive of syphilis, including mononuclear inflammatory cells and clusters of treponemal forms in the tissue, confirmed by a positive rapid plasma reagin test. The clinical findings—combined with the history of exposure and the characteristics of the ulcer—strongly indicated oral syphilis."
