        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Erythrocytosis was observed in two patients undergoing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) concurrently with SGLT2 inhibitors, supported by laboratory findings of severe increases in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell counts. The increase in erythrocyte mass was deemed a response to TRT and possibly influenced by the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors."
