        "final_diagnosis": "Transient aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection and autoimmune hemolytic anemia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Nutritional deficiencies, systemic diseases, infiltrative processes, exposures, pure red-cell aplasia, hemolytic anemia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's anemia was attributed to parvovirus B19 infection after noting her rapid hemoglobin decline, presence of reticulocyte count less than 0.5%, and her son's recent illness consistent with parvovirus infection. Further evaluation identified a likely warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia superimposed on the parvovirus B19 infection, supported by a direct antiglobulin test and findings on peripheral blood smear."
