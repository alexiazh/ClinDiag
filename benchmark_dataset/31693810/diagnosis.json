        "final_diagnosis": "glomerulonephritis with coexistent ANCAs and anti-GBM antibodies",
        "differential_diagnosis": "ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM disease, lung cancer, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, lung abscess",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited initial respiratory symptoms suggestive of infection, but the combination of elevated antibody titers, severe renal injury, and biopsy results indicative of glomerular inflammation and alveolar hemorrhage led to the diagnosis of double antibody-positive disease characterized by both ANCA-associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease."
