        "final_diagnosis": "methamphetamine-induced psychosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions following regular methamphetamine use, which persisted for months after stopping the drug. Initial treatment with an atypical antipsychotic showed no improvement, but the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) led to rapid resolution of symptoms, indicating that the psychosis was linked to methamphetamine use rather than a primary psychotic disorder."
