        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ultrasound findings during routine second-trimester examination suggested both complete placenta previa and features indicative of placenta accreta, including large echolucencies within the stroma of the placenta, loss of the normal myometrial echogenic line, and increased vascularity in the lower uterine segment. The risk of accreta was estimated to be more than 60% based on these observations."
