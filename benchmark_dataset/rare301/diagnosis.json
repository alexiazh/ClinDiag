        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of posterior urethral valve was supported by findings of megacystis, bilateral hydronephrosis, significant bladder wall thickening, and subsequent urinary ascites confirmed by MRI. The resolution of hydronephrosis and bladder thickening over time, along with successful management of urinary incontinence, further supported this diagnosis."
