        "history_of_present_illness": "Previous ultrasound examinations at 20 and 24 weeks' gestational age were completely normal. At 28 weeks, megacystis and bilateral hydronephrosis were detected. By 29 weeks, significant fetal ascites with elevated diaphragm and thoracic compression were observed alongside oligohydramnios (AFI of 2.7 cm). The urinary tract evaluation indicated significant bladder wall thickening, resolution of previously observed megacystis and hydronephrosis suggesting spontaneous bladder rupture leading to urinary ascites. At 30 weeks, increasing fetal abdominal circumference, persistent ascites, and further signs of cardiopulmonary changes were noted, necessitating more invasive interventions. By 34 weeks, relapse of megacystis and bilateral pyelectasis were observed, leading to a planned elective cesarean delivery.",
