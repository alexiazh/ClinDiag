        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital glutamine synthetase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by evidence of severe brain malformations in two unrelated newborns, manifesting as congenital glutamine deficiency. Both patients exhibited undetectable serum glutamine levels and had homozygous mutations in the glutamine synthetase gene, which significantly reduced enzyme activity. This led to multiorgan failure and confirmed the diagnosis of congenital systemic glutamine synthetase deficiency."
