        "final_diagnosis": "Anorexia nervosa",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with significant weight loss (33% over 10 months), cachexia, fatigue, and various physiological abnormalities such as bradycardia and low testosterone levels. The ongoing symptoms and severe malnutrition point towards anorexia nervosa, particularly given the physical signs of nutritional compromise and the patient's behavior regarding food intake during hospitalization. Additional indicators included the patientâ€™s psychiatric assessment that suggested disordered eating patterns, despite his statements denying an eating disorder. His behavioral inconsistencies reinforced the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa as opposed to EDNOS."
