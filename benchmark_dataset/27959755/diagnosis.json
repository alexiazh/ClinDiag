        "final_diagnosis": "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) due to a heterozygous de novo mutation in BCL11B (p.N441K)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant was identified through newborn screening, which detected profound T-cell lymphopenia and no detectable T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in BCL11B, causing a dominant negative effect that impaired T-cell development and was associated with craniofacial anomalies and absence of the corpus callosum. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and functional studies indicated that the mutated BCL11B interfered with its normal function."
