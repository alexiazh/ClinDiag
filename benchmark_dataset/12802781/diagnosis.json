        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed severe hepatotoxicity, indicated by progressively elevated AST levels, following a course of rifampin-pyrazinamide therapy. Despite initial normal liver enzyme levels and careful monitoring, the patient's AST level rose dramatically, and he subsequently required liver transplantation due to the extent of hepatic necrosis."
