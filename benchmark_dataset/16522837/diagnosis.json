        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms G is a generally healthy 71-year-old woman with no active medical issues, negative family history for colon cancer, and consistently negative home-based fecal occult blood testing (FOBT). Her reluctance to undergo colonoscopy stems from previous adverse reactions to anesthesia and logistical challenges. However, her physician recommends screening, emphasizing that the benefits of detecting colorectal cancer early outweigh her concerns, especially given her age and health status."
