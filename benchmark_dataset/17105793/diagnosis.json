        "final_diagnosis": "Locally advanced prostate cancer",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with gross hematuria and significantly elevated PSA level (240 ng/mL). Imaging revealed a large prostate mass infiltrating the bladder, and biopsy confirmed Gleason 8 prostate adenocarcinoma. Hormone levels indicated a feminized male, and antiandrogen treatment led to a substantial decrease in PSA, indicating an active androgen receptor pathway in the cancer progression."
