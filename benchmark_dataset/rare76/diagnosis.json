        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia was supported by laboratory investigations showing high prolactin levels (1346 mIU/L) and by imaging results indicating a mass lesion affecting the pituitary infundibulum, which can contribute to elevated prolactin levels. Clinical symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, and menstrual irregularities also supported the diagnosis."
