        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Meige's syndrome was supported by the clinical picture, drug history of neuroleptic treatment, and the observation of blepharospasm patterns that were exacerbated by stress and anxiety. The absence of typical choreoathetotic movements ruled out tardive dyskinesia."
