        "history_of_present_illness": "Polyhydramnios was recognized early in pregnancy, at 19 to 20 weeks of gestation. The motherâ€™s first pregnancy resulted in preterm delivery of a stillborn male at 22 weeks, while subsequent pregnancies led to severe polyhydramnios diagnosed at 19 weeks, resulting in a preterm male infant born at 27 weeks. Symptoms greatly intensified with progressive polyuria observed immediately after birth in the living infants, normalizing in 3 to 4 weeks.",
        "past_medical_history": "The family had three pregnancies with male offspring complicated by severe polyhydramnios. Previous pregnancies with female fetuses were uneventful.

        "family_history": "In one family, the first son suffered from acute, early-onset severe polyhydramnios, while two subsequent pregnancies with female fetuses were normal.",
