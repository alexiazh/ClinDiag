        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mutations in MAGED2 were identified in all affected infants presenting with transient antenatal Bartter’s syndrome. Early-onset severe polyhydramnios and prematurity were observed, which corresponded with the identified genetic defect. The symptoms spontaneously resolved postnatally, indicating the transient nature of the condition."
