        "final_diagnosis": "Hughes-Stovin syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited symptoms such as dyspnoea and haemoptysis, leading to an initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. However, subsequent investigations, including CTPA, revealed uni-lateral peripheral pulmonary artery aneurysms with signs of perianeurysmal inflammation. The persistence of these findings after treatment, coupled with the patient's history of oral and genital ulcers and the unremarkable results for other potential causes, supported the diagnosis of Hughes-Stovin syndrome."
