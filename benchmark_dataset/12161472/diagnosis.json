        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Riedel's thyroiditis was supported by a fine needle aspiration biopsy showing features of chronic thyroiditis and fibrosis, and clinical findings of a massively enlarged, hard thyroid gland causing compressive symptoms along with laboratory tests indicating thyroid dysfunction. Postoperative pathology confirmed extensive fibrosis consistent with Riedel's thyroiditis."
