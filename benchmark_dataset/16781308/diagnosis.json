        "differential_diagnosis": "Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical and histopathologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of incontinentia pigmenti, especially given the presence of vesicular lesions and residual hyperpigmentation. A punch biopsy showed characteristics associated with IP. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal male karyotype, and fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated low-level XXY mosaicism, which explained the survival of the male patient in a condition typically lethal in males."
