        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Two large high-grade dysplasia lesions were found in the gastric body against a background of fundic gland polyposis. Genetic analysis revealed somatic APC mutations in both high-grade dysplasia lesions, indicating development as an FAP-related complication through biallelic inactivation of APC. Histological findings and mutation profiles suggest potential histogenetic linkage between fundic gland polyps and high-grade dysplasia."
