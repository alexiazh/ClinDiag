        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) revealed new myocardial infarction in patients with a history of chronic myocardial infarction. CMR showed late gadolinium enhancement indicating irreversibly injured myocardium, and T2-weighted imaging indicated areas of myocardial edema, which helped distinguish current acute from prior chronic infarction."
