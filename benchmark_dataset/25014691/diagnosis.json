        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse shortly after delivery, combined with echocardiographic findings of severely impaired left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 11%. Other diagnoses such as pulmonary embolism were ruled out due to the lack of findings on CT angiography. The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin levels further supported the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, corroborated by the patient's obstetric history and clinical signs."
