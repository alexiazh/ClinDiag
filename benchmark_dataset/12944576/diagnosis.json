        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a five-month history of upper abdominal pain, persistent elevation of pancreatic enzymes, and complete obstruction of the pancreatic duct. The imaging studies and fine-needle aspiration pointed towards an inflammatory process rather than malignancy. The patient's response to corticosteroids, which resolved his symptoms, supported the diagnosis of autoimmune sclerosing pancreatitis. Key findings that ruled out other diagnoses included the patient's age, absence of a detectable mass, and overall symptomatology consistent with a chronic inflammatory process."
