        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe abdominal pain and hypotension, with abdominal tenderness and rigidity upon examination. Initial lab tests indicated significant blood loss, suggestive of class III hemorrhage. A focused assessment with sonography confirmed fluid in the abdomen, which was suspected to be blood due to the patient's history of liver disease. Emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery, consistent with his acute presentation and prior imaging suggesting celiac-artery stenosis."
