        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. J had an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of 36 events per hour, which classifies him as having severe OSA. His history of nocturnal palpitations, although improved after weight loss, along with his previous polysomnography results, supports the diagnosis of OSA despite his current lack of symptoms."
