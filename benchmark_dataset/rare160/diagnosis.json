        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type 1 was supported by the patient's history of amblyopia, hearing loss, and fetal echography findings suggestive of a cleft palate, which are associated with the syndrome. Additionally, the presentation of the neonate with clubfoot, cleft palate, and a small jaw further aligned with the known manifestations of Stickler syndrome."
