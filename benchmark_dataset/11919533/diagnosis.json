        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The strong clinical association between feeding through a latex-containing nipple and the infant's episodes of respiratory distress, along with the complete disappearance of symptoms when a latex-free nipple was used, supports the diagnosis of symptomatic latex allergy. This case represents a previously unreported reaction of episodic stridor due to latex exposure in a very young infant."
