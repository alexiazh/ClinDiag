        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced palpitations, dizziness, and syncope attributed to fast, sustained ventricular tachycardia confirmed by electrogram. The presence of a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) that had been previously implanted for primary prevention of arrhythmias due to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy contributed to the diagnosis."
