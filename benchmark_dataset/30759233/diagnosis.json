        "final_diagnosis": "Massive ovarian growth due to serous cystadenofibromas in a woman with insulin-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with abdominal pain, enlarged ovaries, and had a history of PCOS with hyperandrogenism and severe insulin resistance. Ultrasound revealed significantly enlarged ovaries, and histological examination confirmed serous cystadenofibromas. The presence of proliferating granulosa cells was noted, suggesting that hyperinsulinemia acted as a granulosa cell mitogen despite the absence of gonadotropin-dependent ovarian function."
