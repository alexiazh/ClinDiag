        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Echocardiographic examination revealed limited mobility of mitral valve leaflets, the shape of the leaflets resembling the 'Î©' symbol, all chordae inserted into the posteromedial papillary muscle (PM), and the presence of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) with evidence of a small left ventricle. Autopsy confirmed the findings, noting all chordae connected to an elongated posteromedial PM with narrowing at the mitral valve opening."
