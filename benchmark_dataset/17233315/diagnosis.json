        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of epidural hematoma (EDH) was based on the child's presentation following head trauma, lack of external injury, drowsiness observed on neurological examination, and confirmation through CT scan which revealed an extensive left-side frontotemporoparietal EDH and an overlying temporal bone fracture. The child's known condition of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) was significant as it predisposed him to severe complications following trivial injuries."
