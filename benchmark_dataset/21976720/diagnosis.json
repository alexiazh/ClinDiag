        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a heterozygous inactivating PAX8 mutation (p.K80_A84dup) in the patient with a thyroid histology showing absent or very small follicles resembling fetal thyroid tissue indicates disrupted thyroid follicular growth. This mutation was detected in both the lymphocytes and the thyroid, consistent with a somatic mosaic state, and supports the conclusion of congenital hypothyroidism."
