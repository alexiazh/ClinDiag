        "differential_diagnosis": "temporal encephalitis, idiopathic epilepsy, arteriovenous malformations, cavernomas, cerebral vasculitis, multiple sclerosis, infectious lesions",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms Q presented with a first seizure, and radiological workup revealed a mass in the right temporal lobe diagnosed as a low-grade glioma. The tumor transformed to a grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma at the third resection, indicated by MIB-1 staining showing a proliferative fraction of 50%. The tumor's behavior and recurrence patterns suggested malignant transformation."
