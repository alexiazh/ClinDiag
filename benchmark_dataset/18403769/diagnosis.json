Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated cryptococcal meningitis, confirming the diagnosis. Imaging studies showed no signs of acute neurological events, and the patient's preexisting risk factors for cryptococcal infection were identified, including immunosuppression from transplantation and a known low-level cryptococcal infection prior to the transplant."
