        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Diagnosis was confirmed through kidney biopsy which showed Congo red positive deposits with apple-green birefringence under polarized light. This was supplemented by immunofluorescence studies that indicated positivity for fibrinogen and normal results for other amyloid types. Molecular studies identified a mutation in the fibrinogen A/H9251 chain."
