        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms C's symptoms are consistent with functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain and early satiety, with no evidence of severe organic disease from physical examination and normal lab results. Her heartburn symptoms resolved with omeprazole, indicating GERD is unlikely, and her lower abdominal discomfort suggests possible coexistence with IBS."
