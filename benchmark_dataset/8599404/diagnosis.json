        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic paranoid schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with psychotic features",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history and symptoms were inconsistent with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. The atypical and multisensory nature of her hallucinations, along with significant sleep disturbance and her serum, CSF, and MRI results, suggested probable neuroborreliosis as the underlying cause. Changes in her psychiatric symptoms following antibiotic treatment also supported this diagnosis."
