        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Secondary Hypothyroidism due to Exon Skipping in the TSH/H9252-subunit gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was made based on the identification of a homozygous mutation in the donor splice site of the TSH/H9252 gene, which was confirmed through sequencing. The mutation led to exon skipping, producing a severely truncated TSH molecule with no biological activity, corroborated by the patient's clinical presentation of typical symptoms of hypothyroidism and laboratory findings indicating low TSH and thyroid hormone levels."
