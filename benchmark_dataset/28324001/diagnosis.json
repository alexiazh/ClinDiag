        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients had biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CYP24A1, presenting with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and suppressed serum PTH, with elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Treatment with rifampin normalized calcium and PTH levels, indicating effective mineral metabolism management."
