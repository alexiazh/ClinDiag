        "chief_complaint": "Unexplained hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria",
        "history_of_present_illness": "Case 1 presented with recurrent episodes of hematuria and extensive bilateral nephrocalcinosis, initially diagnosed as hypercalcemia. Case 2 presented 2 years previously with poor growth, hypercalcemia, and hypercalciuria, leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. Both patients exhibited suppressed serum PTH and abnormal vitamin D metabolite levels, with improvements following rifampin treatment.",
        "past_medical_history": "Both patients had biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CYP24A1 associated with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Case 1 had nephrocalcinosis and previously elevated vitamin D levels related to extensive sun exposure and dietary vitamin D. Case 2 was on a low-calcium and low-vitamin D diet prior to treatment.",
        "family_history": "Case 1's parents were heterozygous carriers of CYP24A1 mutations, but clinically unaffected. Case 2's siblings were heterozygous carriers for one of the mutations without any clinical symptoms.",
        "social_history": "Case 1 had a history of extensive sunbathing without protective sunscreen and unrestrained consumption of vitamin D-rich foods. For Case 2, social history is not specified."
