        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established through a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy that confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 6, indicating clinically localized prostate cancer. The patient's low PSA level and lack of metastatic disease supported the classification of the cancer as low risk."
