        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's presentation of a persistent wet cough since birth, findings from a chest CT scan showing abnormal bronchial bifurcation, bronchoscopy revealing yellow, serous secretions from an anomalous orifice, and fistulography indicating contrast material progressing to the hepatic region. Additionally, the technetium-99m scintigraphy showed radionuclide accumulation in the normal biliary pathway and a small amount in the fistula."
