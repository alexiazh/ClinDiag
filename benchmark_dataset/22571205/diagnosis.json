Key features included the coalescing of lesions with scalloped borders, fever, and malaise. The presence of herpes simplex virus was confirmed with direct fluorescent antibody testing and culture. Differential diagnoses included other conditions that could explain her symptoms, but the clinical findings significantly favored KVE."
