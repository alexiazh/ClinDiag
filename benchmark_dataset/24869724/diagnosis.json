        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe, persistent left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a loculated pleural effusion indicative of a potential malignant process, given the history of heavy smoking. The differential ruled out various infections, including a negative tuberculin test and negative sputum for acid-fast bacilli, and the negative results for pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis diminished thromboembolic disease as a cause. Ultimately, the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma was confirmed via VATS, revealing malignant epithelioid neoplasm."
