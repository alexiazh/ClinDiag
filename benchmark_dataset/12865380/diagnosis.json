        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. C presented features typical of temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome, including cognitive and affective disturbances along with significant memory impairments that have persisted since childhood. Neurologic evaluation and investigations pointed towards multifocal abnormalities, particularly in the left frontal and temporal lobes. His symptoms, including auras and behavioral changes, correlate with established profiles of temporal lobe seizures, further supported by EEG and neuroimaging findings."
