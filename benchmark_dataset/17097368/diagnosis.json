        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with failure to thrive, severe skin eruption unresponsive to oral zinc supplementation, hypoproteinemia, anemia, and clinical deterioration leading to sepsis. Postmortem histologic examination of the pancreas showed features suggestive of cystic fibrosis and genetic testing confirmed the homozygous d-508 mutation associated with CF, while the skin manifestations were consistent with acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption, which can occur in CF."
