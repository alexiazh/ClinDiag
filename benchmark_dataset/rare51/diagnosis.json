        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with bilateral lower limb lymphedema and had a history of severe perinatal edema that resolved after several months. Clinical examination revealed specific signs of lymphedema, and past medical history excluded cardiac, renal, and hepatic causes of edema. Genetic testing identified three rare nucleotide variations in the PIEZO1 gene that co-segregated with the disease in the family, confirming the diagnosis of Dehydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis (DHS)."
