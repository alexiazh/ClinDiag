        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by radiological evidence of generalized abnormality of endochondral ossification with irregular, flared, radioopaque regions in the metaphyses, and histopathological findings indicating islands of calcified cartilage within bone. The resolution of radiological changes in the mid-teens and recovery of histopathology further supported the diagnosis of RMD as a possible rare phenotypic variation of APECED resulting from autoimmune mechanisms."
