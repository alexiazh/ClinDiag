        "history_of_present_illness": "Symptoms began in early childhood with mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and Addison's disease. The patient presented at age 9.5 years with pain on walking, waddling gait, marked genu valgum, and abnormal radiological findings with progression observed over time. Pain limited walking distances by age 11.4 years, and severe linear growth failure occurred alongside radiological progression. By mid-teens, a notable regression of metaphyseal abnormalities was observed through skeletal evaluations.",
        "past_medical_history": "Mucocutaneous candidiasis diagnosed during the first year of life; hypoparathyroidism diagnosed at age 2.4 years after seizures; Addison's disease diagnosed at age 3 years; keratitis-uveitis diagnosed at age 10 years; primary gonadal failure diagnosed at age 16.9 years.",
