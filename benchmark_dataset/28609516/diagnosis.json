        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a purpuric rash, polyarthralgia, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) led to the consideration of IgA vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy showed small-vessel intravascular IgA deposits, which are characteristic of IgA vasculitis. Negative serologic tests for other causes, along with the patient's clinical presentation, supported this diagnosis."
