    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Anaplastic oligodendroglioma with allelic loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Low-grade astrocytic tumor, low-grade oligodendroglioma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included seizures and a nonenhancing right frontal-lobe lesion with mass effect. MRI and metabolic studies suggested a primary brain tumor, with the differential diagnosis including low-grade astrocytic tumors and oligodendrogliomas. Further analysis of tumor tissue revealed histologic features consistent with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and genetic testing indicated loss of 1p and 19q."
