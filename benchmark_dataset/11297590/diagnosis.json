        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Isolated Central Hypothyroidism (ICH) due to mutations of the TSH b gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of severe clinical signs of hypothyroidism, normal serum TSH levels, low free T4 and T3 levels, impaired TSH response to TRH, and ultrasound revealing a hypoplastic thyroid along with magnetic resonance imaging showing a hyperplastic pituitary gland. Additionally, high circulating levels of glycoprotein hormone a-subunit were noted, indicating a genetic mutation leading to congenital ICH."
