    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Embolic strokes due to Löffler’s endocarditis, likely caused by toxocariasis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Preeclampsia, eclampsia, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, transient ischemic attacks, hyperventilation syndrome, drug-induced conditions, primary hypereosinophilic syndrome.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of headaches, visual disturbances, and neck pain, combined with MRI findings of multiple acute ischemic strokes and elevated eosinophil counts, prompted the consideration of Löffler’s endocarditis likely due to a parasitic infection. The serologic tests for parasites and the history of pica suggested an underlying toxocara infection. Other causes such as eclampsia, thrombosis, and drug effects were ruled out based on laboratory evaluations and imaging studies."
