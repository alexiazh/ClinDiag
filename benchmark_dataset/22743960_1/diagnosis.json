        "final_diagnosis": "Anaphylactic-like reaction to methylene blue",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced flushing and increased airway pressures following intradermal administration of methylene blue, which was interpreted as an anaphylactic reaction. Immediate treatment with epinephrine led to subsidence of symptoms, supporting the diagnosis. Despite negative tryptase levels and subsequent allergy testing, the reaction's characteristics were consistent with an anaphylactic-like event."
