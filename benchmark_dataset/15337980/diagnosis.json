        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sensorineural hearing impairment, mild palmoplantar keratoderma, ichthyosiform scaling, follicular hyperkeratosis, and keratitis, consistent with KID syndrome. Genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous mutation (C119T) in the GJB2 gene, leading to a substitution in the connexin 26 protein (A40V), which is associated with syndromes of deafness and hyperkeratotic skin disorders."
