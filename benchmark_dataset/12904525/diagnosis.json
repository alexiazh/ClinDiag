        "final_diagnosis": "Schönlein–Henoch purpura",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Renal-cell carcinoma, endocarditis, mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis, glomerulonephritis, systemic vasculitis, aortic graft infection",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a purpuric rash, hematuria, abdominal pain, and evidence of renal failure were key to the diagnosis. The identification of red-cell casts on urinalysis, which were found only on a repeated analysis, confirmed the diagnosis of glomerular disease. Abdominal imaging raised concerns for diverticulitis, but the purpuric rash and subsequent biopsy indicated a vasculitic process consistent with Schönlein–Henoch purpura."
