    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Familial partial epilepsy with variable foci, night terrors, periodic limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, familial paroxysmal kinesiogenic and nonkinesiogenic dyskinesia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical suspicion of ADNFLE was confirmed by genetic testing showing a mutation in the CHRNa4 gene, which is known to be associated with ADNFLE. The patient's seizures were characterized by their occurrence during stage 2 sleep, and initial EEG findings were normal, which is typical for ADNFLE. The patient also had a positive family history of similar seizures."
