        "final_diagnosis": "Vasculitis with alveolar hemorrhage, possibly isolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "1. Pulmonary Edema 2. Infection 3. Cancer 4. Inflammation (including respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia) 5. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis 6. Sarcoidosis 7. Organizing pneumonia 8. Pulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis 9. Granulomatous–lymphocytic interstitial lung disease 10. Blood or Hemorrhage (including idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, anti–glomerular basement membrane disease, microscopic polyangiitis, isolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included chronic respiratory symptoms, ground-glass nodular opacities on imaging, and persistent fevers. Despite extensive testing, common infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic causes were excluded. The diagnostic process pointed towards vasculitis with alveolar hemorrhage, specifically isolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis, as suggested by the presence of high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies and biopsy findings of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage."
