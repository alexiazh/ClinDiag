        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of partial TBG deficiency was based on the identification of a specific C-to-T mutation in the signal peptide of the TBG gene, which led to a key amino acid substitution (His to Tyr) affecting secretion efficiency while maintaining normal binding affinity and heat stability. Serum TBG levels were variable, reflecting impaired cotranslational processing."
