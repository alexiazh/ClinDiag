        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical presentation (fever, chills, night sweats), laboratory findings (positive cultures for Nocardia asteroides), and imaging results (echodense aortic valve with lesions, aortic regurgitation). The patient's history of injection drug abuse and the findings of vegetation and abscess during valve replacement surgery further confirmed the diagnosis."
