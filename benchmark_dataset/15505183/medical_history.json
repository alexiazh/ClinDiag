        "history_of_present_illness": "Patient 1 exhibited normal psychomotor development until age 3, when he developed increasing walking difficulties, falls, augmented muscle tone, and dystonic posturing, leading to wheelchair dependence within 10 years. Patient 2 had delayed psychomotor development, possibly due to rhesus incompatibility, and also developed walking problems and dystonia after age 3, becoming wheelchair-bound within 7 years. The symptoms were effectively managed with L-dopa therapy initiated at ages 12 and 24, respectively, with significant improvement noted.",
