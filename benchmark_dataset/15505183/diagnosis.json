        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical findings, and the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation in the tyrosine hydroxylase gene. The patients exhibited a substantial and sustained response to L-dopa therapy, normal neuropsychological assessments, and no significant cognitive or neurologic impairment over a long-term follow-up."
