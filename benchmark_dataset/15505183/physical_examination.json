Patient 2 (age 41 years): Inability to stand or walk, bradykinesia, generalized dystonia, increased muscle tone, brisk tendon reflexes, and extensor plantar responses.",
            "changes_over_time": "Patient 1: Initially had severe generalized dystonia, but after L-dopa treatment, muscle tone, hand functions, and gait normalized. At age 53, follow-up was normal. Patient 2: Initially wheelchair-bound with truncal hypotonia and dystonia; treatment led to normalization of gait, but panic disorder episodes occurred after dosage changes. Resumed L-dopa therapy resulted in gradual normalization of neurologic examination within 1 week."
