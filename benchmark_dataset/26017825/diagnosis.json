        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by the presence of metastatic tumor deposits in lymph nodes, histopathological examination revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and positive immunohistochemistry for thyroid transcription factor 1, consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing detected a deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, which is associated with sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
