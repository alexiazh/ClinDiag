        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with right hemiparesis, disturbance of consciousness, and findings of a watershed infarction in the left parietal lobe. MR angiography and aortography revealed a dissecting aneurysm with severe stenosis in the left CCA, leading to the diagnosis. Histological examination of a skin biopsy corroborated the EDS Type IV diagnosis, revealing fragmented elastic fibers and disarrangement of collagen."
