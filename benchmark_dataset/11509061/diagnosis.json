    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Chronic tension-type headache and migraine without aura",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Headache associated with trauma, vascular disease, nonvascular intracranial disorders, substance use or withdrawal, noncephalic infections, metabolic disorders, disorders of facial or cranial structures, cranial neuralgia, chronic sinusitis, cervicogenic headache, hemicrania continua, caffeine withdrawal headache, daily persistent headache, posttraumatic headache",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms T exhibits frequent and severe headaches characterized by a steady pressing quality, primarily located on the left side, which align with the criteria for chronic tension-type headache. Additionally, her history of migraines and the overlapping features of both headache types complicate the diagnosis. Neurologic examination results were normal, and previous imaging was unremarkable, which helped rule out secondary causes."
