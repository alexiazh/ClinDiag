        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis was supported by the presence of c-ANCA positivity and elevated PR3 levels during the relapse. The patient's symptoms of chronic nasal congestion, hearing loss, fever, and the observed laboratory results, including elevated hs-CRP and ESR levels, along with imaging showing otomastoiditis and sinusitis, contributed to this conclusion."
