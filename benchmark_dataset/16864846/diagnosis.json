        "final_diagnosis": "oncogenic osteomalacia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with generalized weakness, muscle wasting, and diffuse bone pain, leading to significant disability. Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsy were conducted, revealing type 2 fiber atrophy and normal nerve conduction. Radiological findings showed marked demineralization and multiple fractures. Laboratory tests indicated hypophosphatemia and high alkaline phosphatase levels. The discovery of a benign phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor demonstrated excessive FGF-23 production, consistent with oncogenic osteomalacia. Following excision of the tumor, the patient's serum phosphorus and FGF-23 normalized, and clinical symptoms improved significantly."
