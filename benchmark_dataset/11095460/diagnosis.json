        "final_diagnosis": "Resistance to TSH due to a novel mutation in the TSH receptor gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of partial resistance to TSH was supported by genetic analysis revealing a homozygous mutation (Cys310) in the TSH receptor gene, observed in two siblings. This resulted in elevated TSH levels but normal thyroid hormone concentrations, indicative of euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia. In vitro studies demonstrated the mutation caused loss of TSH-binding ability while exhibiting constitutive receptor activity."
