        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe nasal airway problems due to a prior septal operation and was diagnosed with Behçet disease, as he had a history of oral and genital ulcerations along with other symptoms typical of the disease. The presence of pustular lesions postoperatively, which regressed without scarring, indicated the interplay between surgical trauma and the patient's underlying condition. Treatment involved preoperative steroids, and the patient's symptoms correlated with the characteristics of Behçet disease."
