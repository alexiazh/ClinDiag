        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PNH was based on the patient's clinical presentation of hemolytic anemia with symptoms such as hemoglobinuria, extreme fatigue, abdominal pain, and thrombocytopenia. Diagnostic testing revealed elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and flow cytometric analysis showed the absence of GPI-anchored proteins (CD55 and CD59) in granulocytes, which is characteristic of PNH."
