        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of QS-IBM was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of progressive limb weakness that spared the quadriceps muscle, along with genetic findings of two novel missense mutations in the GNE gene linked to the disease. MRI and muscle biopsy revealed relative preservation of the quadriceps muscle and myopathic features, respectively."
