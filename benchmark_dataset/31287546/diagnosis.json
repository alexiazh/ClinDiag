        "final_diagnosis": "Familial hyperaldosteronism type I (GRA) with adrenal adenoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of GRA was reached after identifying the coexistence of adrenal adenomas and somatic KCNJ5 mutations in two siblings who presented with hypertension. Clinical investigations revealed elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations and low plasma renin activity, coupled with confirmatory findings from imaging and hormone testing, leading to successful treatment of hypertension through unilateral adrenalectomy."
