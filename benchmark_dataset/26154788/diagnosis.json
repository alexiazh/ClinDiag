        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the detection of VSBV-1 RNA in the brains of three patients with similar symptoms, which included fever, confusion, and progressive encephalitis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral antigens, and epidemiological links among the patients as breeders of variegated squirrels indicated zoonotic transmission. Additional evidence included pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid, cranial imaging findings, and the absence of other infectious agents."
