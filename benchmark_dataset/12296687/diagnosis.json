        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of arachnoiditis ossificans (AO) was supported by clinical findings of chronic low-back pain and intermittent left-sided sciatica, as well as radiological evidence from spinal radiography and CT scans demonstrating intradural, periradicular ossifications at L-4 and pathological enhancement. The patient's symptoms were mild and well controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indicating no immediate need for surgical intervention."
