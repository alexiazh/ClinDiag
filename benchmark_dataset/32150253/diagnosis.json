    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Transient neonatal hypocalcemic seizures",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant presented with low serum calcium (1.57 mmol/L) and normal PTH levels, indicating hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms were consistent with hypocalcemic seizures, which were likely transient, linked to maternal hypercalcemia correlated with the mother's familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH1). Rapid improvement in serum calcium following treatment further supported this diagnosis."
