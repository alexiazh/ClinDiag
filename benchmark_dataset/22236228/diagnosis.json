            "Infection (bacterial, mycobacterial, protozoal, fungal, or viral)",

        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with violaceous, bullous lesions on the hands post-trauma, initially suggesting necrotizing cellulitis. However, extensive work-up including negative cultures, absence of systemic infection signs, and worsening lesions despite antibiotics led to consider non-infectious etiologies. A biopsy revealed neutrophilic dermatitis consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. Clinical criteria for pyoderma gangrenosum were met due to rapid progression, typical presentation, and response to glucocorticoids. The presence of thrombocytopenia and other concerning hematological signs suggested an underlying malignancy, confirmed as a myelodysplastic syndrome."
