        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of normosmic complete congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) was established based on the presence of homozygous mutations in TAC3 and TACR3 genes, clinical manifestations such as typical hypogonadism, low plasma testosterone and serum LH levels coupled with normal or nearly normal FSH levels, and normal MRI findings. The restoration of gonadotropin and testosterone levels following pulsatile GnRH administration further supported the hypothalamic origin of the gonadotropin deficiency."
