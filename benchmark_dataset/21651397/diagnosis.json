    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Inflammatory breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma), triple negative (negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Locally advanced breast cancer with secondary inflammatory changes",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation (large breast mass, axillary lymphadenopathy, erythema, and peau d'orange changes) was consistent with inflammatory breast carcinoma rather than locally advanced disease, due to the short clinical course of symptoms and her relatively young age. Imaging studies and confirmatory biopsies revealed characteristics typical of inflammatory breast cancer, including poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with negative hormone receptor status."
