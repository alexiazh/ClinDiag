        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with rapid loss of vision and symptoms indicating posterior uveitis. Examination findings showed no signs of keratitis and were consistent with posterior uveitis. The differential diagnosis was narrowed by the subacute presentation and denial of any eye trauma, leading to the conclusion that the case was suggestive of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis when the history of intravenous drug use was revealed."
