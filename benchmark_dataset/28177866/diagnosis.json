        "final_diagnosis": "X-linked periventricular heterotopia associated with a mutation in FLNA and congenital alveolar dysplasia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, defects of surfactant metabolism, interstitial lung disease, lung hypoplasia, Marfan's syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with respiratory failure, failure to thrive, and multiple congenital anomalies including aortic and pulmonary arterial dilation, and periventricular heterotopia. Genetic testing revealed a mutation in FLNA, which is consistent with the observed malformations and respiratory issues. Differential diagnoses were considered based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of periventricular heterotopia and congenital alveolar dysplasia."
