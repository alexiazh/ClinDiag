        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of primary amenorrhea, sexual infantilism, hypertension, and abnormal hormonal levels. Biochemical and molecular studies confirmed a novel Phe93Cys missense mutation in the CYP17 gene, leading to significantly reduced enzymatic activity, consistent with the diagnosis of 17-OHDS."
