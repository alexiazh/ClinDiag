        "final_diagnosis": "Senna-Induced Hepatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fatigue, myalgias, epigastric pain, pyrosis, and nausea, along with scleral icterus and elevated liver function tests after consuming senna tea. The patient's genetic predisposition as a poor metabolizer (CYP2D6*4 variant) was identified. A controlled re-exposure to the herbal tea resulted in a dramatic increase in liver function levels, confirming the association between senna intake and hepatitis."
