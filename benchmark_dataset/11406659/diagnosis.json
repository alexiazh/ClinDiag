        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by histological evaluations showing extensive amyloid deposition in the liver parenchyma of both patients, with identical patterns of amyloid deposits confirmed by Congo red staining. The presence of the Arg26 mutation in the Apolipoprotein A-I protein and a clinical history of nephropathic systemic amyloidosis further corroborated the diagnosis."
