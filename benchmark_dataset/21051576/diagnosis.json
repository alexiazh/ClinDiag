        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's neuropathic pain was associated with her poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and her past history of an eating disorder. Physical examination showed significant pain sensitivity, alongside evidence of autonomic nerve dysfunction and a highly toxic autoimmune response to neuronal cells in culture. The distinct characteristics of her pain and associated conditions indicated insulin neuritis syndrome as a possible etiology for her neuropathy."
