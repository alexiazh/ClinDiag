        "final_diagnosis": "Familial erythrocytosis type 2 due to severe germline VHL deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with early systemic onset, severe neonatal hypoglycemia, and marked erythrocytosis. Genetic characterization revealed homozygosity for a novel synonymous mutation in the VHL gene (c.222Câ†’A; p.V74V), leading to significantly reduced levels of functionally normal VHL protein. Clinical features such as hypotension, limited exercise capacity, hypoglycemia, and altered cellular metabolism further supported the diagnosis of this unique syndrome, which differed from canonical familial erythrocytosis type 2."
