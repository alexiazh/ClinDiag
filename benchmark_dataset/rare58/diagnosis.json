        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Wilson's Disease was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of progressive binocular vision blurring, kinetic tremors, dysarthria, and mental status changes, alongside key laboratory findings such as decreased ceruloplasmin levels, elevated urinary copper excretion, and the presence of K-F rings on examination. Imaging studies revealed characteristic hyperintense changes in the basal ganglia on MRI, and genetic testing confirmed ATP7B pathogenic variants."
