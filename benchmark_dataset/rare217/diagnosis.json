        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome was supported by the identification of the TREX1 homozygous variant, consistent imaging findings of cystic structures and abnormal signals in the fetal brain, and the observed fetal growth restriction. Genetic testing indicated both parents were carriers, strengthening the likelihood of an inherited disorder."
