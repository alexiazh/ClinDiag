        "final_diagnosis": "Primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's high serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level at 22,815 ng/mL, elevated PIVKA-II level, and pathological examination revealing a multinodular solid mass consisting of poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (20%) and large- and small-cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma (80%). The tumor's characteristics, including invasion of the right anterior portal vein and microvessels, also contributed to the diagnosis."
