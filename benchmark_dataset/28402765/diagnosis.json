    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Follicular lymphoma (grade 1–2 of 3; stage IV of IV)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Indolent lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcomas, ovarian cancer, retroperitoneal fibrosis, sarcoidosis, Castleman’s disease, reactive or infectious causes",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hydronephrosis and a large retroperitoneal mass. Non-malignant causes for massive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy were considered but deemed unlikely. Considering the age, symptoms, and findings, indolent lymphoma, particularly follicular lymphoma, was considered the most likely diagnosis. Core biopsy confirmed the presence of small B-lymphoid cells consistent with follicular lymphoma, supported by immunohistochemical staining showing BCL2 rearrangement."
