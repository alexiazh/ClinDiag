        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical presentation of optic atrophy, disproportionate upper extremity weakness, and ataxia, along with nerve conduction study findings suggesting axonal peripheral neuropathy, raised suspicion for Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVL). The final diagnosis was confirmed by whole-exome sequencing, which identified compound heterozygous variants in the SLC52A2 gene."
