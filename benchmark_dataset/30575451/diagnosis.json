        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's acute presentation of jaundice, fever, and right upper quadrant pain, along with the severe leukocytosis and the finding of a gas-containing hepatic abscess on CT, strongly indicated Clostridium perfringens septicemia. The laboratory findings of hemolyzed blood samples and pigmenturia suggested intravascular hemolysis consistent with septicemia caused by C. perfringens."
