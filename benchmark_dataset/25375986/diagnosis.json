        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with bilateral nephrolithiasis and hypercalcemia after excessive vitamin D intake. The L409S mutation was identified on one allele of the CYP24A1 gene. Assays indicated that the mutant activity was 32% of the wild-type, supporting a diagnosis of hypercalcemia related to a CYP24A1 deficiency."
