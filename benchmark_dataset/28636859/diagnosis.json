        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation, MRI findings of thickened and clumped nerve roots, elevated protein levels, and markedly diminished glucose in CSF indicated a neurological process affecting multiple nerve roots, likely of malignant origin. The need for tissue confirmation through nerve-root biopsy led to the diagnosis of an infiltrative lymphoma, especially considering the pattern of disease progression and the CSF abnormalities."
