        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with unilateral ptosis, which indicated weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Rapidly progressing weakness, including bulbar symptoms (dysarthria and dysphonia) and respiratory failure, was consistent with myasthenia gravis. Additional findings such as ptosis without pupil involvement and the absence of limb involvement favored this diagnosis. CT scans revealed extensive vascular issues and a mass in the mediastinum suggestive of thymoma, known to be associated with myasthenia gravis. Clinical symptoms and features emerged rapidly, supporting a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and its complications."
