        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening midback pain, leg weakness, and neurological deficits, which were indicative of spinal cord compression from a paraspinal abscess. Cultures were largely negative despite adequate sampling, and a positive PPD test suggested possible tuberculosis. However, subsequent cultures revealed gram-negative bacteria consistent with Burkholderia species, and identification confirmed B. pseudomallei, making melioidosis the final diagnosis. The lack of typical tuberculosis findings, such as granulomas, and the patient's history of exposure were significant factors in the diagnosis."
