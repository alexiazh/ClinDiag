        "final_diagnosis": "Pituitary Macroadenoma associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by multiple evidences including the patient's symptoms (growth acceleration, acromegaloid features, hyperprolactinemia), imaging (MRI showing pituitary macroadenoma), elevated prolactin levels, and molecular genetic testing revealing a heterozygous mutation in the MEN1 gene and loss of the remaining allele in the tumor. This configuration confirmed the tumor as an MEN1-associated lesion."
