        "final_diagnosis": "Choroideremia (carrier status with severe visual acuity loss secondary to presumed choroidal neovascular membrane)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's family history of retinal degeneration and choroideremia, along with abnormal visual findings including progressive visual acuity loss, the development of a central scotoma, and the identification of a novel mutation in the CHM gene confirmed through DNA analysis. The patient's symptoms and findings were consistent with choroideremia, particularly given the family history and the documented visual acuity decline along with other retinal changes."
