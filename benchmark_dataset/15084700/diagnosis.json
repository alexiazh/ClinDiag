        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The acute aortic syndrome was suspected due to the migratory nature of the pain, maximal intensity at onset, enlargement of the aortic root, aortic regurgitation, and associated mediastinal inflammation. Imaging studies indicated a proximal aortic dissection or intramural hematoma."
