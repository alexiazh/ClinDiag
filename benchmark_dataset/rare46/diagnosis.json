        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Floating-Harbor syndrome was supported by the patient's significant growth delay, a normal 46 XY karyotype, a range of phenotypic abnormalities including facial and skeletal anomalies, intellectual disability, and partial somatotropin deficiency as evidenced by a growth hormone stimulation test. Additionally, despite a thorough investigation, no other endocrine dysfunctions or significant abnormalities were found."
