        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with elbow pain and radiographs confirmed that the axle assembly had come apart due to a fracture of the tongs on the inner pin. The fragmented hinge assembly was found within the olecranon bursa. The presence of significant swelling and a prior history of elbow arthroplasty indicated a complication related to the implant."
