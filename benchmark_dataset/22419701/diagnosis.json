        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient was diagnosed with 25-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency based on consistently low 25-hydroxylase enzyme function, elevated alkaline phosphatase and PTH levels, and decreased phosphate and calcium, which were corrected with 1,25(OH)2D therapy. There were no detectable mutations in the coding regions or intronic junctions of the CYP2R1 gene, suggesting an alternative inheritance pattern."
