            "findings": "Remarkable for bilateral fraying and cupping of the metaphysis of distal femurs, proximal tibiae, and proximal fibulae with no fracture or dislocation and bilateral mild varus deformities consistent with rickets. Wrist radiograph also showed signs of rickets. Bone maturation was interpreted as consistent with 15 months at the chronological age of 20 months.",
            "changes_over_time": "Increased bowing of bilateral lower extremities noted over time, growth deceleration to below the first percentile by age 4 years and 5 months, and development of coarse trabeculation involving distal femur and proximal tibia and fibula bilaterally noted at 4 years and 2 months."
