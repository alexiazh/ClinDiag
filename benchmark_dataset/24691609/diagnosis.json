        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. M was diagnosed with DCIS following an excisional biopsy of a breast lesion initially classified as highly suggestive of malignancy. The biopsy results indicated that two of nine slides were positive for intermediate-grade DCIS. Estrogen receptor staining was strongly positive, and a reexcision showed no residual DCIS."
