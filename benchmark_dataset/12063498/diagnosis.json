        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with tuberculosis, including positive response to antituberculosis therapy. Pathological examination confirmed erythema induratum with granulomatous features. Biopsy specimens showed lesions compatible with granuloma annulare, which healed after treatment. Despite negative PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in GA lesions, the association of GA with tuberculosis was highlighted by the treatment response."
