        "differential_diagnosis": "Endocarditis, catheter-related infection, endovascular infection",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of aortoenteric fistula was prompted by the patient's recurrent bacteremia with cultural evidence of gut commensals, and the absence of endocarditis signs on transesophageal echocardiography suggested a gastrointestinal source of the infection. Surgical findings confirmed the presence of a fistula between the duodenum and the graft, supporting the diagnosis."
