    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Hyperphosphatemic hyperostosis syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a mass on the left elbow, laboratory findings of hyperphosphatemia, low iFGF23 level, and high TRP level. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed calcified deposits with multinucleated giant cell formation, and genetic analysis revealed a homozygous variant in the GALNT3 gene consistent with Hyperphosphatemic Familial Tumoral Calcinosis (HFTC). Follow-up imaging confirmed the calcified mass, reinforcing the diagnosis."
