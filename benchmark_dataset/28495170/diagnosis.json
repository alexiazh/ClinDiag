        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of HMOX1 deficiency was reached after extensive genetic testing and exclusion of various known anomalies. Key findings included the identification of a homozygous deletion in the HMOX1 gene, confirmed in both parents as carriers. Autopsies of the fetuses revealed severe congenital anomalies consistent with HMOX1 deficiency symptoms, including asplenia and growth retardation."
