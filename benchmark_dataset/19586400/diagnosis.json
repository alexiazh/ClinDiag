        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Severe Acute Hepatitis B (SAHB) was made based on the presence of hepatic encephalopathy, elevated serum bilirubin levels (314 mmol/L), and significant coagulation disturbances (prothrombin time of 21.3 s and international normalized ratio of 1.85). These findings exceeded the diagnostic criteria proposed for SAHB, confirming the diagnosis."
