        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's worsening dyspnea, systemic edema, and marked cardiomegaly observed in a chest x-ray. Key findings included pronounced concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, preserved ejection fraction, and significant pulmonary hypertension. A transthoracic echocardiogram, right heart catheterization, and histopathological examination indicated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The persistent vertical vein was detected through a contrast-enhanced CT scan, which explained the left-to-right shunt."
