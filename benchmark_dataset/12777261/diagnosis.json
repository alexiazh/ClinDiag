        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on the observation of Alex's significant weight loss, restriction of food intake, and engagement in binge/purge behaviors, which are characteristic of anorexia nervosa. Additionally, the presence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors was confirmed through endoscopy and subsequent surgery, which indicated a comorbid medical condition exacerbating his eating disorder. Key findings included malnutrition leading to substantial weight loss and a cancer diagnosis contributing to his disordered eating behavior."
