        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient reported ingestion of a fidget spinner leading to severe neck pain and vomiting. Radiographic imaging confirmed three metallic objects in the esophagus. The size and configuration of these objects indicated a presumptively benign course, but their large size and jagged edges likely contributed to complications, including possible perforation."
