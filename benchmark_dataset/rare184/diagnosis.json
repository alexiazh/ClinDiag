        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome was supported by genetic testing results, which showed approximately 101 CGG repeats in the patient's FMR1 gene. The patient's mother was a premutation carrier, and further analysis indicated the presence of both unmethylated and methylated FMR1 alleles. Additional tests confirmed a deletion in the FMR1 gene and a significant lack of FMRP expression in cultured lymphocytes, suggesting silencing of the FMR1 gene."
