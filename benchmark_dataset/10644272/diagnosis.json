        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hepatic failure was made after the patient developed nonspecific symptoms shortly after starting rosiglitazone therapy, with laboratory tests showing marked abnormalities in liver function before the onset of hypotension. Other causes of hepatic failure, including viral and toxic etiologies, were excluded through serologic testing and toxicology screening."
