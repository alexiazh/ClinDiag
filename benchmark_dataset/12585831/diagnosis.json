        "final_diagnosis": "Venous ulcer secondary to venous insufficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Arterial insufficiency, neuropathy, ulcers caused by prolonged pressure",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a significant ulcer on the lower leg, associated with history suggestive of venous disease (e.g., varicosities, edema). The appearance of the ulcer (yellowish base, granulation tissue, scaly brown hyperpigmentation) along with normal ABI and transcutaneous oxygen measurements were consistent with venous ulcers, leading to the diagnosis of venous ulcer due to venous insufficiency."
