        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a large, multilobulated cystic mass in close proximity to the pancreas along with elevated lipase levels suggested a pancreatic origin. Initial imaging did not show an inflammatory history typical of pseudocysts. The histological examination revealed characteristics supportive of a congenital hamartoma rather than a neoplastic lesion, given the presence of immature mesenchymal tissue and pancreatic acinar tissue."
