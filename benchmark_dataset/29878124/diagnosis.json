        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hypertension and elevated 24-hour urine norepinephrine and dopamine levels. Imaging revealed metastatic disease with involvement of specific bone regions, while negative iodine-123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) and bone scans indicated atypical behavior, supporting the diagnosis of aggressive paraganglioma with SDHC mutation."
