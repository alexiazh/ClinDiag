        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited severe hypothyroidism with undetectable serum thyroglobulin and elevated serum TSH levels, alongside a normally shaped but hypoplastic thyroid gland that failed to respond to TSH stimulation. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous inactivating mutation (T477I) in the TSH receptor, consistent with the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism due to TSH unresponsiveness."
