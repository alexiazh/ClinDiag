        "differential_diagnosis": "Secondary syphilis, acute infection with toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), enterovirus, rickettsial disease, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella–zoster virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a constellation of symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection, including fever, headache, rash, vomiting, and signs of meningitis. The positive nucleic acid testing for HIV-1 RNA, along with weakly positive antibody tests, supports the diagnosis. The patient's HIV exposure history and the rapid onset of symptoms further substantiated this assessment."
