        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients had stable ocular findings over a 7-year period, with nonprogressive visual field defects and characteristic optic nerve head changes suggestive of glaucoma. Despite previously being diagnosed with glaucoma, no significant changes in optic nerve appearance or visual field defects were noted, indicating that they may not have had the disease."
