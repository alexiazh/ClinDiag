        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included generalized lymphadenopathy, a diffuse rash, and liver lesions, which were suggestive of an infectious process rather than a lymphoproliferative disorder. Tuberculosis, particularly papulonecrotic tuberculid, was strongly considered due to the clinical history, chronicity, dermal manifestations, lymphadenitis, and confirmed positive interferon-Î³ release assay for M. tuberculosis."
