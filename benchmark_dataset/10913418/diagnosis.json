        "final_diagnosis": "Disseminated Mycobacteriosis caused by Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium triplex",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Toxoplasma encephalitis, Tuberculous meningoencephalitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the identification of necrotizing granulomatous process with acid-fast bacilli in tissue samples, demonstrating disseminated disease after prior successful treatment for other conditions. Culture results confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium triplex, and its resistance to standard antituberculous drugs suggested a distinct pathogenic role."
