        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with chronic diffuse hair shedding, but various tests (including iron studies, thyroid function tests, and hormonal levels) were normal. Serial scalp biopsies consistently demonstrated a high ratio of terminal to vellus hairs, indicating CTE rather than female pattern hair loss. Follow-up evaluations showed no decrease in hair density despite ongoing shedding, supporting the diagnosis of CTE."
