        "final_diagnosis": "Type 2 Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis after initiating amiodarone therapy, with laboratory findings showing elevated free T4 (65 pg/ml) and suppressed TSH (<0.01 mU/liter). Thyroid ultrasonography showed a slightly hypoechogenic gland without nodules, and color flow Doppler sonography indicated absent hypervascularity. Thyroid radioactive iodine uptake values were very low, consistent with type 2 AIT, leading to the final diagnosis."
