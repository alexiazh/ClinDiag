        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 30-year-old Indian male on a vegetarian diet, had repeat testing confirming vitamin D deficiency with a subsequent appropriate rise in serum parathyroid hormone levels. After self-treatment with UVB-irradiated mushrooms over 3 months, blood tests showed a significant increase (129%) in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and a decrease in parathyroid hormone levels, supporting the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency."
