        "final_diagnosis": "Homozygous STAT5b mutation resulting in growth hormone insensitivity",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a homozygous frameshift mutation in the STAT5b gene was identified, which leads to severely reduced levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3, while growth hormone secretion characteristics were normal. The patient's clinical features included short stature, delayed puberty, and elevated prolactin levels, confirming the diagnosis of STAT5b deficiency without obligatory immunodeficiency."
