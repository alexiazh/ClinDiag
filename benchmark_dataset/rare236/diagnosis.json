        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with bilateral eye redness and nodular lesions on the conjunctiva that did not respond to anti-inflammatory treatment. An excisional biopsy revealed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of grade I to II. Imaging studies did not show any dissemination beyond the orbit, supporting a localized diagnosis."
