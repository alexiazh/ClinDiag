        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with Sweet's syndrome, characterized by papules and plaques, along with fever and arthralgias. However, upon further investigation including a skin biopsy and thorough infectious workup, a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis was confirmed when lymph node biopsy revealed acid-fast bacilli. This late finding led to the conclusion that the Sweet's syndrome was likely a reaction to an underlying, undiagnosed M. tuberculosis infection."
