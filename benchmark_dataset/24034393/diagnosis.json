        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of an ulcerated and bleeding nodule on the scalp, pathologic examination revealing superficial spreading melanoma with Breslow thickness of 5 mm, and the absence of associated nevocellular nevus. Genetic analysis identified a germline PTPN11 missense mutation, which is relevant to the LEOPARD syndrome context."
