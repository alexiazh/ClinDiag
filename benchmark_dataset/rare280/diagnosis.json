        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with early childhood proximal muscle weakness, motor development delays, significant scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, and specific physical findings such as micrognathia and clinodactyly. Needle electromyography showed a myopathic pattern. Genetic testing revealed compound heterozygosity for variants in the STAC3 gene, confirming the diagnosis."
