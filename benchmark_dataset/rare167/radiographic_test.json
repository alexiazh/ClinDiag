            "findings": "Sinus tachycardia with evidence of left atrial and left ventricular (LV) enlargement. LV ejection fraction was 40-45% with moderately decreased global LV systolic function. LV fractional shortening was decreased at 18%. The aortic root and ascending aorta were without dilatation. The right and left atria, as well as the right ventricle, were normal. The mitral and pulmonic valves had normal anatomy and function; however, the tricuspid valve had trace regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 21 mmHg.",
