        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. Q presented with a history of progressive bilateral neuropathic symptoms, which were initially attributed to plantar fasciitis. The worsening of symptoms led to nerve conduction studies revealing mild distal axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, consistent with diabetic polyneuropathy, especially given her diagnosis of diabetes and poor glycemic control."
