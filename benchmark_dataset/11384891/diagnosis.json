        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PTSD was made based on a structured diagnostic interview revealing traumatic experiences related to kidnapping, sexual assault, and prolonged psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms of PTSD manifested notably after these traumatic events, including heightened fears, dissociation, and compulsive behaviors. Previous treatments for panic disorder and OCD were ineffective, highlighting the necessity for focused PTSD treatment."
