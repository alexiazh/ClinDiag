        "final_diagnosis": "Epsteinâ€“Barr virus infection with predisposition to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed a symptomatic EBV infection after receiving a nerve allograft from an EBV-positive donor. The immunosuppression regimen was stopped prematurely, and laboratory tests showed elevated anti-Epstein Barr viral capsid antigen IgG and IgM levels, indicating a recent infection. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, along with the context of immunosuppression, pointed toward a causal relationship, leading to the final diagnosis of EBV infection with predisposition to PTLD."
