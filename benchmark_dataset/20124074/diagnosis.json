        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of congenital afibrinogenemia and symptoms of severe elbow pain, along with physical examination findings and radiographic evidence of severe degenerative arthritis, led to the diagnosis of severe elbow arthropathy. A total elbow arthroplasty was deemed necessary due to the progressive nature of his condition and previous joint treatments not providing sufficient relief."
