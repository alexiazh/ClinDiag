        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) associated with HPV 11. Chest radiographs showed an enlarging right upper lobe mass, and bronchial washings confirmed invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Autopsy findings indicated cavitary papillomas in the lungs and the presence of a 4.5-cm well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, supporting the association between HPV 11 and malignant transformation."
