        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Cushing's disease was established based on elevated urinary free cortisol levels, increased ACTH levels, and clinical features consistent with hypercortisolism. Pituitary MRI revealed a microadenoma, and ACTH studies demonstrated a central/peripheral gradient. Surgery led to normalization of cortisol levels and resolution of symptoms."
