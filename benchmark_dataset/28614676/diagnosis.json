        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden onset of food refusal and weight loss after a traumatic choking incident. The diagnosis of ARFID was supported by the patient’s fear of choking affecting her consumption of solid foods, her long-term low body weight, and the psychosocial impact on her family life. Unlike anorexia nervosa, there was no fear of weight gain or body image disturbance, and her eating habits were inconsistent with classic features of anorexia. Furthermore, her prior medical evaluations did not support other underlying conditions."
