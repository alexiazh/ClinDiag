        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of tick bites and erythema migrans, along with serologic testing showing immunoglobulin M antibodies against B. burgdorferi. Imaging studies revealed a large scleral mass with associated ocular symptoms. Treatment with corticosteroids led to rapid improvement, suggesting an autoimmune mechanism."
