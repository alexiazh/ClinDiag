        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient met all DSM-III criteria for delayed posttraumatic stress disorder, with no precombat psychopathology, drug use, or false symptoms. The symptom-free interval lasted over 30 years, only manifesting after health deterioration and retirement. Nightmares and intrusive thoughts about World War II began after retirement, indicating a psychological response to stress and loss of prior self-sufficiency. Key symptoms included frequent nightmares directly relating to traumatic wartime events."
