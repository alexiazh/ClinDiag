        "final_diagnosis": "Acute interstitial nephritis with the nephrotic syndrome due to the use of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (ibuprofen), with acute tubular necrosis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, tubular disease, vascular disease, secondary membranous glomerulonephritis, autoimmune glomerulonephritis.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The rapid decline in renal function, normal hematocrit, urinary findings consistent with tubulointerstitial disease (proteinuria, pyuria, and tubular cells), and the high correlation with ibuprofen exposure led to the diagnosis of acute allergic interstitial nephritis. Further changes in laboratory results and worsening symptoms suggested acute tubular necrosis superimposed on interstitial nephritis."
