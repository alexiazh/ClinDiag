        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of skeletal fluorosis was supported by the patient's long history of consuming large volumes of brewed tea, elevated serum fluoride levels, high bone mineral density, characteristic radiological findings of diffuse osteosclerosis, and associated symptoms such as severe chronic bone and joint pain and kyphosis. These factors collectively indicated the presence of skeletal fluorosis resulting from fluoride exposure through tea consumption."
