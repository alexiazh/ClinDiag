        "final_diagnosis": "Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) with persistent atrophic scarring and hyperpigmentation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the history of facial lesions present since birth and the presence of maternal anti-SS-A(Ro) antibodies. The patient's extensive evaluation was unremarkable for other abnormalities. The skin findings included persistent dyspigmentation, scarring, and atrophy. Treatment led to significant improvement, further supporting the diagnosis of NLE."
