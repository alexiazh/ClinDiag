        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on the identification of a homozygous missense variant (c. 890G>T p.R297L) in KISS1R, evidenced by low testosterone levels during neonatal evaluation, abnormal mini puberty characterized by microphallus and bilateral cryptorchidism, and normal timing of adolescent puberty with mature hormonal response as he approached puberty."
