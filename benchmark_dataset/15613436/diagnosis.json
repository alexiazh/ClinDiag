        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A novel germline mutation IVS2-1G>A in the HRPT2 gene was identified in a family with HPT-JT syndrome, causing aberrant splicing of HRPT2 transcripts, leading to premature termination of parafibromin protein. The mutation was confirmed not to be present in unaffected family members or 100 control individuals, supporting its pathogenic role."
