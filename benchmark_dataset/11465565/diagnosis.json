        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ARVD was made based on the presence of two major criteria: familial disease confirmed by histological findings, and fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy, along with three minor criteria. This was particularly relevant given the patient's family history of sudden cardiac death associated with ARVD."
