        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was confirmed through MRI findings of leptomeningeal enhancement and multiple acute infarcts, CSF analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis, hypoglycorrhachia, and positive cryptococcal antigen tests. A biopsy revealed fungal elements consistent with Cryptococcus. These findings indicated ongoing intracranial pathology that was supported by the patient's symptoms, history of recurrent headaches, and cognitive decline."
