    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Complete Estrogen Insensitivity (CEI) due to ESR1 gene mutation (Q375H)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Isolated FSH Deficiency, Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism, Aromatase Deficiency",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CEI was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of absent breast development, primary amenorrhea, and elevated estrogen levels, alongside the identification of a homozygous ESR1 mutation (Q375H) that disrupts estrogen signaling. Hormonal evaluations revealed persistently elevated serum estradiol levels and impaired gonadotropin feedback. Despite treatment with Diethylstilbestrol (DES), no secondary sexual characteristics developed, underscoring the insensitivity to estrogen. Ultrasound findings identified multiple ovarian cysts with significantly elevated ovarian volume."
