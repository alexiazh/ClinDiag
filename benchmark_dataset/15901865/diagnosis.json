    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "AL amyloidosis involving the kidney, heart, liver, pleura, and possibly lungs, colon, and the autonomic nervous system",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Systemic lupus erythematosus, Congestive heart failure, Ischemic colitis, Other plasma-cell dyscrasias",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was suggested by the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, a monoclonal gammopathy, heart failure characteristics, and the pattern of organ involvement. The echocardiogram showed thickening of the myocardium and a restrictive filling pattern, while the endomyocardial biopsy revealed amyloid deposits with classic apple-green birefringence upon staining. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and the presence of macroglossia further supported the diagnosis."
