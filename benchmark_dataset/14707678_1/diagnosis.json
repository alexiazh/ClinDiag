        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe nasal airway problems after a history indicating significant past surgical interventions and existing Behçet disease. The surgical approach included using intravenous steroids pre- and post-surgery to mitigate risks associated with the patient's underlying condition. The postoperative development of pustular lesions, consistent with symptomatology of Behçet disease, was documented, which regressed without scarring, indicating successful management and recognition of the disease's impact on surgical outcomes."
