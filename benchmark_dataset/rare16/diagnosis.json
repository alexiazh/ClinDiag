        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Timothy syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including syncope due to TdPs, markedly prolonged QT intervals, 2:1 AV block, and characteristic dysmorphic features. Genetic testing identified a novel pathogenic variant p.R412M in CACNA1C, confirming the diagnosis according to ACMG guidelines."
