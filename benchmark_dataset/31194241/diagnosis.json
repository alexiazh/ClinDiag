        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on the identification of sympathetic PGL or PHEO in patients with SDHD gene mutations despite normal levels of catecholamines in blood and urine. This was supported by imaging that revealed metastatic disease in some patients and the long interval between initial SDHD diagnosis and discovery of silent lesions."
