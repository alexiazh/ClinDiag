        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The rapid onset of symptoms, the cortical ribboning pattern on MRI, and abnormal EEG findings led to the consideration of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. The patient's visual distortions and cognitive symptoms, the MRI findings, and positive CSF tests for 14-3-3 protein and elevated t-tau protein supported the diagnosis of sCJD."
