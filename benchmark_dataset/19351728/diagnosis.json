        "final_diagnosis": "Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (PNDM) due to KCNJ11 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PNDM was made based on the identification of a novel in-frame deletion (residues 28-32) in the KCNJ11 gene, which resulted in reduced ATP inhibition and increased K_ATP currents, correlating with the patient's hyperglycemia. The patient was stable on sulfonylurea therapy, confirming the diabetes diagnosis linked to the mutation."
