        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed neurological symptoms including painful meningo-radiculitis and myositis after a recent wild turkey hunting trip in an endemic area for Lyme disease, alongside typical signs of polyradiculopathy and myopathy. Testing showed positive B. burgdorferi IgG in CSF samples, which combined with the clinical presentation, confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis."
