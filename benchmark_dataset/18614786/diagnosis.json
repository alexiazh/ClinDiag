    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Infectious pneumonia, probably due to Aspergillus species and probably complicating chronic granulomatous disease.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pulmonary tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia species, Paragonimus, sarcoidosis, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical presentation, imaging studies, and the skin biopsy findings indicated a chronic granulomatous process. The patient had been exposed to an adult with pulmonary tuberculosis, which increased the suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the negative tuberculin skin test and clinical characteristics did not fully support this diagnosis, leading to consideration of other infectious and non-infectious causes. Ultimately, the biopsy revealed necrotizing granulomas with hyphae indicative of aspergillosis, complicating underlying chronic granulomatous disease."
