        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's psychosis had no prior history until age 52, characterized by auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions, which improved with antipsychotic treatment. Differential diagnoses were considered, including the impact of his seizure disorder; however, it was determined to contribute to vulnerability rather than causation. Neuropsychological assessments ruled out dementia and supported a diagnosis of late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, fitting DSM-IV criteria despite initial exclusions based on age of onset. The long-term remission and functioning normalization underscored the diagnosis."
