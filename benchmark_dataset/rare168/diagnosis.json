        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of tricuspid valve agenesis was supported by intra-operative findings showing complete absence of the posterior tricuspid valve leaflet and subvalvular apparatus. The transthoracic echocardiogram and further imaging confirmed the severe tricuspid regurgitation and anatomical abnormalities, which aligned with the patient's clinical presentation of worsening dyspnoea, lower limb oedema, and heart failure symptoms."
