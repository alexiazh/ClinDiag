        "differential_diagnosis": "Clostridium difficile colitis, aortitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, malignancy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with constitutional symptoms and severe abdominal pain. Tests showed inflammation with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Imaging revealed intimal thickening of the aorta, confirming suspicion of aortitis likely related to giant-cell arteritis, which was supported by temporal artery biopsy findings."
