        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of chronic schizoaffective disorder was made based on the patient's long history of psychiatric symptoms, including pronounced behavioral cycles, auditory hallucinations, and various mood changes. The patient's lack of response to individual treatments but significant improvement with the combination of lithium and neuroleptic therapy indicated the complexity of her condition."
