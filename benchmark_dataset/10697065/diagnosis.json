        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited slow, progressive memory loss, which has been concerning for both him and his family. His memory failures became apparent under stress, and he demonstrated significant cognitive decline over time. Examinations, including neuropsychiatric tests and MRI, showed mild cognitive impairments without other significant causes identified, leading to a high likelihood of Alzheimer's disease."
