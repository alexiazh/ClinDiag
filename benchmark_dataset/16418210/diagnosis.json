        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Kallmann Syndrome was supported by the presence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, olfactory dysfunction, and dental agenesis in the proband, along with the identification of a 2-bp deletion in the FGFR1 gene, which is predicted to cause a frameshift mutation leading to a loss of function. The clinical features observed align with the established characteristics of Kallmann Syndrome."
