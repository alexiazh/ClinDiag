        "differential_diagnosis": "Polyarteritis nodosa",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with renal failure, severe anemia, abdominal pain, weight loss, and inflammation of the eyes. A renal biopsy revealed acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, which is characteristic of TINU syndrome. The absence of typical autoimmune disease markers and negative ANCA tests support TINU or polyarteritis nodosa as most likely diagnoses."
