        "final_diagnosis": "Overlap myositis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with progressive proximal muscle weakness, bilateral ptosis, and dysphagia after a stable course for several years. Blood tests revealed elevated creatinine kinase levels and positive antinuclear and transcription intermediary factor 1-gamma antibodies. Imaging studies showed evidence of myositis, and muscle biopsy was consistent with necrotising myopathy, leading to the diagnosis of overlap myositis."
