        "final_diagnosis": "congenital aromatase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital aromatase deficiency was confirmed by genetic analysis showing homozygosity for a mutation in the CYP19 gene, leading to elevated testosterone levels and undetectable serum estradiol despite full pubertal development. The patient's continued linear growth and open epiphyses were indicative of estrogen deficiency, corroborated by physical examination and hormonal assays."
