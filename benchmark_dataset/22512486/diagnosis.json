    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Ileocolonic intussusception associated with syncope (neurologic intussusception)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Seizures, head trauma, infection (meningitis or encephalitis), accidental ingestion, metabolic derangement, cardiac arrhythmia, evolving sepsis, primary neurologic diseases.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's persistent altered mental status, intermittent vomiting episodes, normal neurologic examination, and negative neuroimaging suggested a non-neurologic cause, with the diagnosis of intussusception being strongly supported by radiographic findings indicative of the condition. The normal neurologic parameters and the clinical history led to a high suspicion of neurologic intussusception."
