Imaging findings revealed characteristic changes in the basal ganglia, particularly hyperintensity in the left putamen on T1-weighted MR images. Other potential causes were considered but ruled out based on clinical presentation and imaging characteristics. Additionally, the patient's symptoms correlated with the resolution of hyperglycemia, further supporting the diagnosis."
