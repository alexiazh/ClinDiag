        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on the identification of a homozygous mutation in the iodotyrosine deiodinase gene (IYD) in the index patient who presented with severe hypothyroidism and a multinodular goiter. Urinary measurements of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) supported the defect, and the presence of the same mutation in a sibling indicated familial transmission."
