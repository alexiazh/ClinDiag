        "final_diagnosis": "normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH) due to KISS1R mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a novel homozygous KISS1R mutation (c.953T.C), which led to significant impairment in receptor signaling. Hormonal assays indicated low estradiol levels with inappropriately normal gonadotropin levels and a complete lack of breast development, indicating partial isolated gonadotropic deficiency. The patient's response to pulsatile GnRH therapy, which resulted in LH surge and ovulation, further substantiated the diagnosis."
