        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis for Patient 2 and Patient 3 was based on elevated TSH levels and low T4 levels in newborn screening, along with ultrasound findings of a hypoplastic thyroid gland. For Patient 1, findings showed low TSH levels and high free T3 and T4 levels, indicating non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH receptor mutations Cys636Arg and Pro639Leu in these patients provided a genetic explanation for their conditions."
