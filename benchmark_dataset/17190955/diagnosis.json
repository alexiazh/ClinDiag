        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient lacks endogenous synthesis of monoamines due to severe DHPR deficiency, supported by undetectable DHPR activity in liver biopsy, fibroblasts, and erythrocytes, and identified homozygous mutation in the QDPR gene. Clinical symptoms included moderate mental retardation, episodes of parkinsonism, and episodes of depression, with the patient showing no dopaminergic neuronal loss on PET imaging despite long-term levodopa treatment."
