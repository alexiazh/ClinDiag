            "relevant_findings": "Initially, the patient was pale, somnolent, made few movements, hypersalivated, and could not fix his eyes at age 1 month. At age 29, cognitive efficiency was considered poor with Mini-Mental State score of 21/30, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale score of 117/144, and IQ of 67. Following an 18-hour treatment discontinuation, parkinsonism symptoms like severe akinesia, rest tremor, bilateral ptosis, and hypersalivation were observed.",
            "changes_over_time": "At age 4 months, the patient could hold his head up and manipulate objects; at age 6 months, he was considered normal despite slightly delayed psychomotor development. Episodes of acute parkinsonism occurred twice a year from age 9, with rapid recovery post-levodopa treatment. At age 29, no parkinsonian symptoms or dyskinesia were observed, but cognitive deficits were noted."
