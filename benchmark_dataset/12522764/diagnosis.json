        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of mupirocin-resistant MRSA infection was supported by the isolation of MRSA with a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis chromosomal pattern identical to that of MRSA isolated from household contacts. Further recurrent infections in the patient and his wife were linked to the presence of MRSA in their pet dog, which was shown to be the source of reinfection upon successful eradication from the dog's nares."
