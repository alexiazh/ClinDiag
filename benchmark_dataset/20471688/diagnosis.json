        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of multiple Coccidioides sp. microorganisms identified in a vitreous biopsy, along with chronic intraocular inflammation and a lack of systemic infection, despite extensive evaluation. The patient's previous treatment for pulmonary Valley fever and the specific ocular findings contributed to the diagnosis."
