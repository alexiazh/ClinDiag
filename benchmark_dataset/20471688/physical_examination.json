            "relevant_findings": "Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The anterior segment was unremarkable except for the presence of whitish keratic precipitates and 1/H11001 flare in the right eye. The vitreous in the right eye revealed 2/H11001 cells and 2â€“3/H11001 haze. Multiple grey-yellowish retinal infiltrates were also observed in the right eye, mostly located inferiorly, around an area of chorioretinal scarring.",
            "changes_over_time": "Best-corrected visual acuity initially improved to 20/80 after treatment but intraocular inflammation progressed despite interventions, leading to blindness in the right eye and eventual enucleation."
