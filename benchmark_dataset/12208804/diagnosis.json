        "final_diagnosis": "Drug-Induced Long-QT Syndrome associated with a subclinical SCN5A mutation (L1825P)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "An elderly woman experienced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes following treatment with cisapride. Genetic analysis revealed a novel L1825P mutation in the SCN5A gene, which was associated with biophysical abnormalities indicative of long-QT syndrome. The patient had a normal QT interval prior to drug exposure, suggesting that the mutation was subclinical until triggered by the drug. Key evidence also included the patient's significant bradycardia and ECG findings during episodes, which supported the diagnosis of drug-induced long-QT syndrome."
