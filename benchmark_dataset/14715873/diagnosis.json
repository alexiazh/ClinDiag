        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a novel germline mutation (H132P) in the SDHB gene in affected family members, clinical presentation consistent with catecholamine-secreting tumors, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis showing loss of one SDHB allele in tumors. Additionally, there was a familial pattern of the disease and increased urinary norepinephrine levels."
