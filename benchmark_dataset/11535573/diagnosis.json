        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) due to de novo mutation in the SCN5A gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of LQTS was established based on a prolonged QTc interval of 600 ms and recurrent episodes of tachyarrhythmia (TdP) documented through ECG. Genetic analysis revealed a de novo missense mutation (Ala1330Pro) in the SCN5A gene, not present in the parents, suggesting a novel mechanism affecting cardiac channel activity leading to QT prolongation."
