        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sirolimus-induced PRES was based on the neurological presentation of right occipital pain, visual deterioration, MRI findings of a right occipital hematoma and T2 hyperintensities suggestive of PRES, and the temporal relationship of symptom onset with sirolimus administration. None of the other medications or known causes for PRES were demonstrable."
