        "final_diagnosis": "Birt–Hogg–Dube syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on genetic testing which revealed a change-in function mutation in the FLCN gene. The patient's clinical history of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and bilateral renal cysts, which are not typical for ADPKD, supported exploring alternative diagnoses. Moreover, the absence of mutations in known ADPKD-causing genes further directed the diagnosis towards Birt–Hogg–Dube syndrome."
