        "differential_diagnosis": "Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, Behçet’s disease, amebic colitis, salmonella infection, yersinia infection, campylobacter infection",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of intermittent symptoms and lack of response to anti-TNF therapy suggested a diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis rather than Crohn’s disease. The endoscopic findings, including granulomas and acid-fast bacilli observed in biopsy specimens, alongside high fecal calprotectin levels and negative interferon-γ release assay, further supported the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis."
