    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acromegaly due to GH-secreting pituitary adenoma with somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (sst5) mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acromegaly was confirmed by hormonal data showing elevated GH and IGF-I levels. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 10-mm pituitary adenoma. The patient's resistance to somatostatin analogs, specifically octreotide, was linked to a somatic activating mutation in sst5 that abrogates the antiproliferative action of somatostatin, along with a mutation in the Gs/H9251 gene that activates adenylyl cyclase."
