        "differential_diagnosis": "pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, ectopic ACTH from medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed by positive proopiomelanocortin mRNA in situ hybridization in MTC tissue, while plasma ACTH decreased significantly after neck dissection, indicating MTC as the source of ectopic ACTH. ACTH immunohistochemistry was negative, reinforcing the atypical expression of ACTH in the context of the tumor."
