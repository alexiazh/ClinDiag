        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia was supported by the patient's clinical history of recurrent infections and neutropenia, evidenced by laboratory tests showing compensatory monocytosis and episodic neutropenia patterns. Bone marrow cytology indicated myeloid maturation arrest and further genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation in the SRP54 gene, thus confirming the diagnosis."
