        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of retinal venous thrombosis was supported by the patient's symptoms of nasal scotoma in the left eye, the clinical examination revealing venous tortuosity and dot blot hemorrhages, and confirming the presence of heparin-induced antiheparin-platelet factor IV antibody. The association of the antibody with the thrombotic event and the patient's history of protein C and S deficiencies suggested HIT thrombosis syndrome as the underlying cause."
