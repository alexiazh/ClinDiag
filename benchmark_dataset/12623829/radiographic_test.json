            "changes_over_time": "During the hospitalization, the patient showed improvement in visual symptoms. One week after discharge, worsened visual symptoms were noted, with increased tortuosity and dot hemorrhages in the left fundus. A subsequent retinal blood circulation study showed further decrease in venous blood velocity. After 4 months of warfarin treatment, the retinal blood circulation study indicated reduction of retinal venous diameters toward normal caliber. By 7 months after initial presentation, visual acuity remained 20/20 in both eyes, and retinal veins were no longer tortuous; hemorrhages had resolved."
