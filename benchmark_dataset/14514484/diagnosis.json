        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. A's recurrent major depression was diagnosed based on her clinical presentation, which included depressed mood, loss of interest, low energy levels, cognitive deficits, and a history of depression exacerbated by the death of her husband and a previous stroke. The diagnosis was further supported by a brain MRI revealing moderately severe subcortical white matter disease, consistent with vascular depression."
