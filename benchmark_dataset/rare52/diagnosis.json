        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of heavy proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in blood culture. The evolution of symptoms, including severe edema and the development of thrombocytopenia, alongside the MRI findings of basal ganglia lesions, further corroborated the diagnosis."
