        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Carney triad was supported by the presentation of three tumors—gastric stromal tumor (GIST), pulmonary chondroma, and paraganglioma—in a series of young women, with evidence of multifocality and the statistical unlikelihood of such tumors occurring together by chance. The initial cases prompted further investigation leading to the identification of additional similar cases in the literature."
