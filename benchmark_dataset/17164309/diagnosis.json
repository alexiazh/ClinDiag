        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of isolated mineralocorticoid deficiency was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, along with the identification of a W105C missense mutation in the DAX1 gene, which is associated with the condition. Functional studies confirmed that the mutation resulted in mild loss of DAX1 function."
