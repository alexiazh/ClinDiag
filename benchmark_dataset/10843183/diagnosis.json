        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of severe 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency was established through molecular studies that revealed a homozygous C to A transversion in the HSD3B2 gene. This mutation resulted in the complete loss of enzymatic activity, which was supported by elevated plasma concentrations of precursor steroids and the absence of detectable activity in the patient's enzymatic assays."
