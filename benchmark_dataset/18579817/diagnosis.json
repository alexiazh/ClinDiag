        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent severe abdominal pain, red urine, hypertension, seizures, hyponatremia, and progressive axonal polyneuropathy. The combination of these clinical features raised suspicion for acute porphyria, particularly given the patterns of pain and nervous system involvement. Laboratory tests that revealed elevated porphyrin precursors supported the diagnosis, alongside the consideration of other potential conditions that were ruled out."
