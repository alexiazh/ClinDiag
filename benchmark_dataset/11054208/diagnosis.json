        "final_diagnosis": "serotonin syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "neuroleptic malignant syndrome, drug intoxication (cocaine, amphetamines, other sympathomimetic agents, anticholinergic agents, other SSRI, or MAOI), intracranial infection, delirium tremens",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The markedly elevated CK levels along with severe myoclonus, hyperreflexia, autonomic instability, agitation, and disorientation in the context of a large SSRI overdose led to the primary diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient exhibited high serum levels of sertraline and desmethylsertraline, unusual clinical features for sertraline toxicity, and temporal clustering of symptoms characteristic of serotonin syndrome."
