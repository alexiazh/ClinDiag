        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of livedoid vasculopathy was made based on the patient's clinical presentation, including symmetrical erythematous patches and painful ulcers on the lower extremities, along with a 7-year history of recurrent chronic livedoid vasculitis. Further diagnostic tests revealed negative laboratory findings for various antibodies and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A skin biopsy showed fibrin degeneration of small blood vessel walls and small thrombi, confirming the diagnosis."
