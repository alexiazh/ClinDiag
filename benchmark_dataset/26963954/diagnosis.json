        "differential_diagnosis": "Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, Antenatal Bartter syndrome, Neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with persistent hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, which were confirmed by genetic testing that identified compound heterozygous mutations in SLC12A1. The family history and clinical features including renal calcification and biochemical profile supported the diagnosis of neonatal primary hyperparathyroidism. The association of SLC12A1 mutations with both neonatal primary hyperparathyroidism and antenatal Bartter syndrome provided additional evidence."
