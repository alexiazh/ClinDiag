        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with prolonged fever, constitutional symptoms, anemia, and elevated ESR levels, which prompted consideration of inflammatory disorders and cancer. Initial imaging suggested a benign uterine mass, but further investigation with FDG-PET-CT revealed a large uterine mass consistent with a malignant process. Biopsy confirmed dedifferentiated leiomyosarcoma, correlating with inflammatory symptoms and fever of unknown origin."
