        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome was supported by the presence of characteristic physical features (high forehead, hypertelorism, skeletal anomalies), significant developmental delays, seizures, and specific cytogenetic findings, including a mosaic karyotype with deletions at 4p16.3. The absence of alternative syndromic features, as well as the FISH analysis which ruled out Williams syndrome, reinforced the diagnosis."
