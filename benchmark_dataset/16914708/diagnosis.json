        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of adiposis dolorosa was established after multiple evaluations, including biopsies that failed to show evidence of lymphoma or other cancer. Key findings included painful subcutaneous nodules, weight loss, fever, and biopsy results showing normal adipose tissue, leading to the conclusion that the nodules were benign lipomas. Although erythema nodosum was initially considered based on biopsy findings, further analyses indicated that the observed changes were inflammatory reactions due to previous biopsies rather than indicative of that condition."
