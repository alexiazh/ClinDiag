        "final_diagnosis": "arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's 24-hour ambulatory monitor documented frequent and complex ventricular ectopy, with multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and 4665 premature ventricular contractions. His abnormal ECG, including incomplete right bundle branch block and T-wave abnormalities, along with evidence of right ventricular akinesia and dilated distal right ventricle on MRI, led to a diagnosis of ARVC. The diagnosis was supported by major and minor criteria, as per the 1994 International Task Force guidelines."
