        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's clinical features, including disproportionate short stature, macrocephaly, low FT4/FT3 ratio, subnormal reverse T3 levels, and the identification of a heterozygous frameshift mutation (Ala382ProfsX7) in the THRA gene. The patient's condition responded positively to thyroxine therapy, with noted improvements in alertness and constipation; however, cardiac parameters remained relatively unresponsive."
