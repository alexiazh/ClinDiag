        "final_diagnosis": "Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of intensely itchy and coalescing papules and plaques, along with histopathological examination revealing stromal lymphocytic infiltration with non-specific chronic dermatitis. HPV-66 was detected by PCR, and the absence of atypia and koilocytes, along with negative immunohistochemistry for p16 and p53, contributed to the diagnostic process."
