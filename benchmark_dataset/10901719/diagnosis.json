        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypertrophic lichen planus",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The initial examination and biopsy confirmed the presence of amyloid deposits in the dermis, consistent with lichen amyloidosis. The patient's history of chronic hypertrophic lichen planus and the characteristics of the lesions supported this diagnosis. Additionally, the disparate response of each condition to treatment further clarified the diagnostic process."
