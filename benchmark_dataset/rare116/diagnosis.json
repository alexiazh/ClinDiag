        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of fatigue, weight loss, persistent headache, the absence of pulse in her upper extremities, a significant blood pressure difference between her arms, and confirmed vascular bruits. Further, the diagnosis was corroborated by arteriographic examination revealing occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk and stenosis of significant arteries."
