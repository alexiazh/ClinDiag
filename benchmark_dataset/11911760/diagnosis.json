        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr S developed major depression following the onset of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Symptoms included loss of interest in usual activities, fatigue, decreased concentration, appetite changes, and excessive sleeping. A thorough assessment confirmed the diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria, and the patient's family was more aware of the symptoms than he was himself. The response to venlafaxine treatment further supported the diagnosis of major depression."
