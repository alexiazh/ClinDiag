        "final_diagnosis": "Heartland virus infection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia rickettsii infection; viral disease; noninfectious entities such as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura or hematological neoplasms.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation with fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, along with a history of tick exposure, led to suspicion of HRTV infection. Autopsy findings revealed HRTV antigens in lymph nodes and spleen, confirmed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR from blood samples, ruling out other tick-borne diseases and demonstrating the distinct presence of HRTV."
