        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient was diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 18, which was confirmed by the presence of a left testicular mass and elevated tumor markers (/H9251-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin). Following treatment with inguinal orchiectomy and chemotherapy, the patient has remained in continuous remission since the end of treatment. No current signs of disease recurrence were identified, and the patient presents with symptoms consistent with late effects of treatment rather than active disease."
