        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by endoscopic findings of multiple yellowish, elevated lesions in the duodenum, dyslipidemia, and a significantly low level of lysosomal acid lipase. The previous diagnosis of Whipple's disease was ruled out as the patient showed no improvement with treatment, and the family history suggested a hereditary lipid disorder."
