        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-associated gynecomastia was supported by the presence of symptoms such as tenderness in breast tissue, a history of cutaneous neurofibromas, and the pathologic examination confirming fibrous changes indicative of neurofibromatosis. An endocrine workup was performed and resulted normal, further supporting the diagnosis of gynecomastia due to neurofibromatosis rather than other causes."
