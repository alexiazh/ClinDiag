        "final_diagnosis": "Pulmonary embolism, nephrotic syndrome secondary to idiopathic membranous nephropathy, primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pneumonia, costochondritis, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax, gastrointestinal causes",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was reached based on the patient's presentation of chest pain, tachycardia, and edema, coupled with the elevated D-dimer levels indicating a high probability of pulmonary embolism. Imaging confirmed multiple pulmonary emboli and an evolving pulmonary infarct. The nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed based on proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema, and renal biopsy confirmed membranous nephropathy. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis linked to primary sclerosing cholangitis was also established via imaging."
