        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of idiopathic syringomyelia was supported by MRI findings that showed a significant syringomyelic cavity measuring about 14.8 mm of the spinal cord and a descent of the cerebellar tonsils associated with Chiari malformation type I. Follow-up imaging demonstrated a reduction in the syringomyelic cavity to 5 mm post-surgery."
