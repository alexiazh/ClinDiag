        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on the patient's presentation of febrile symptoms, oral thrush, and significant immunocompromise due to HIV infection. Blood cultures revealed acid-fast organisms that were subsequently identified as M. fortuitum. The discovery of peduncular vegetations on the aortic valve via echocardiography further supported the diagnosis of endocarditis caused by M. fortuitum."
