        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of chylothorax was made based on the pleural fluid analysis showing raised triglyceride levels and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which likely caused obstruction or erosion of the thoracic duct due to tuberculosis. Other potential causes were considered but trauma was deemed unlikely due to the time laps between catheter insertion and symptom onset."
