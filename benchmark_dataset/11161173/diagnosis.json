        "differential_diagnosis": "Broncholithiasis, empyema, bronchial tumor",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of aspiration approximately 10 years prior, the imaging findings showing a high-attenuation lesion in the bronchus intermedius resembling a chicken vertebra, and the presence of empyema and postobstructive pneumonia. The bronchoscopic examination revealed exuberant reactive tissue obstructing the bronchus intermedius, further supporting the diagnosis of chronic foreign body aspiration."
