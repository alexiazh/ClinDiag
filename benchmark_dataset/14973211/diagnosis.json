        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with confusion, agitated state, cough with soot, and burns over 30% to 60% of body-surface area. A carboxyhemoglobin level of 28% confirmed carbon monoxide exposure. Bronchoscopy showed carbonaceous material in airways, further indicating smoke inhalation injury. Chest radiographs and computed tomography showed signs consistent with inhalation injury and pulmonary edema."
