        "final_diagnosis": "Jeune syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Thanatophoric dysplasia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Jeune syndrome was supported by findings of severe shortening of long bones, narrowed chest with short ribs, bowing of the femur, and excess soft tissue. Additional ultrasound findings included brachydactyly and high probability of pulmonary hypoplasia, presenting a clinical picture consistent with Jeune syndrome rather than thanatophoric dysplasia, which was initially considered."
