        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of persistent, painless swelling of the lower lip, notable tongue edema with a scrotal appearance, and a history of facial nerve palsy. Histopathological examination of a punch biopsy revealed epithelial acanthosis, hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, edema, ectatic blood vessels, and a dense perivascular lymphomonocytic infiltrate, consistent with this syndrome."
