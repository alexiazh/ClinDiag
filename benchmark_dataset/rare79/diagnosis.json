        "final_diagnosis": "Lymphoepithelial-like carcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by endoscopic examination revealing a submucosal tumor closely connected to the muscularis propria, imaging suggesting a mass without surrounding lymphadenopathy, and postoperative pathological findings of low-differentiated carcinoma with immunohistochemical results confirming lymphoepithelial carcinoma. The absence of metastasis and involvement of margins further validated the diagnosis."
