        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a previously unreported heterozygous LPL gene mutation (S172fsX179) and a circulating anti-LPL antibody. This combination was shown to lead to severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis despite standard treatments. The effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy in reducing triglyceride levels further corroborated the autoimmune nature of the condition."
