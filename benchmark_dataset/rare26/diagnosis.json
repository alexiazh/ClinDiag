        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of seizures starting shortly after birth, marked developmental delays, and specific findings on video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and brain MRI indicative of severe neurological impairment. Genetic testing revealed a compound heterozygous variant of the ACTL6B gene consistent with the phenotype."
