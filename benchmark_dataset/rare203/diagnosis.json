        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included limb weakness, absence of menarche and secondary sex characteristics, physical examination findings consistent with infantilism, and laboratory results showing hypokalemia and low adrenal steroid levels. Imaging studies revealed abnormalities in the adrenal glands, and genetic testing identified a homozygous mutation in the CYP17A1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia."
