        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on the patient's clinical presentation, which included profound proximal muscle weakness, significant weight loss, and hypercalcemia after vitamin D repletion. Autopsy revealed a disseminated granulomatous process affecting various muscle types, with immunohistochemistry indicating elevated 1/H9251-hydroxylase in inflammatory infiltrates, which correlates with calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia."
