        "history_of_present_illness": "The patient was diagnosed at age 5 years, with the adenoma being invasive and causing compression of the optic chiasm.

        "family_history": "A family history of MEN1 is apparent, with the father and two aunts having hyperparathyroidism; one of the aunts also has prolactinoma. All affected relatives harbor the same H139D mutation.",
