        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of a MEN1 mutation (c.525C/H11022G; p.H139D), early onset of the mammosomatotroph pituitary adenoma at age 5, elevated prolactin (PRL) and IGF-I levels, invasive features of the macroadenoma, and significant differences in gene expression profiles compared to sporadic tumors, indicating unique molecular pathways in the MEN1-associated tumor."
