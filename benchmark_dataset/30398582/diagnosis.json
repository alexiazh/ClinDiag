        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's history of large fluctuations in blood pressure, which were often low at home but spiked at times, as well as the results from 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring that indicated elevated mean BP levels. The association of hypertensive episodes with anxiety and a high-sodium diet further supported the diagnosis of masked uncontrolled hypertension."
