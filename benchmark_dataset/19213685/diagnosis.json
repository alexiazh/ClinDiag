        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included livedo reticularis, tender nodules, mononeuritis multiplex, and peripheral-blood cytopenias. Previous negative autoantibody tests prompted consideration for potential connective-tissue diseases. A skin biopsy revealed histological features consistent with livedoid vasculopathy, supporting a diagnosis of SLE with livedoid vasculopathy."
