        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Juvenile Paget's disease (JPD) was supported by the clinical presentation, which included severe bone pain, frequent fractures, deformities, and elevated levels of bone turnover markers (total serum alkaline phosphatase). Genetic analysis identified a homozygous mutation in the TNFRSF11B gene, consistent with JPD diagnosis. Signs of accelerated bone turnover and ineffective control of symptoms with prior treatments further confirmed the diagnosis."
