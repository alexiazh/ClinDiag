        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of spontaneous bruising and joint pain, coupled with a markedly elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and a normal platelet count, indicated a defect in the coagulation cascade. The elevated aPTT suggested the presence of an acquired factor VIII inhibitor, especially given the postpartum timeframe. Further testing confirmed the diagnosis."
