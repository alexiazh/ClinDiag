        "final_diagnosis": "Cleft lip syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cleft lip syndrome was supported by the clinical presentation of complete bilateral cleft lip and palate, unique physical features such as prominent prolabium and collapsed nasal structure, and various associated anomalies including polydactyly, camptodactyly, club foot, and triphalangeal thumb. The presence of these multiple congenital anomalies suggests a genetic syndrome."
