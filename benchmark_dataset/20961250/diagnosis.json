        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The acute onset of abdominal pain and the presence of intraabdominal fluid suggested serious obstetric complications. Uterine artery rupture was favored due to the sudden hemodynamic instability and signs of intraabdominal bleeding, which were not accounted for by other diagnoses such as active placental abruption, since fetal monitoring remained reassuring."
