        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital aplasia of the patellar tendon",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Anthrogryposis multiplex congenita, tibial or fibular hemimelia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients exhibited congenital absent patellar tendon and limb length discrepancies. The first patient had a prior misdiagnosis of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, which was reconsidered given the absence of typical features and the specific findings of patellar tendon aplasia, such as a hypoplastic patella and absent patellar tendon confirmed by imaging studies. The second case confirmed the absence of an active quadriceps mechanism, indicating the patellar tendon was not present. Magnetic resonance imaging and radiographic findings supported these conclusions."
