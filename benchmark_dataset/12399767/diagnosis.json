        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The histologic findings in multiple biopsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease). Both patients had a significant history and characteristic symptoms of the disease, and treatments were unsuccessful until the application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid, which led to clinical clearing."
