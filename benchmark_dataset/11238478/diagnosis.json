        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by evidence of hyperkalemia, elevated plasma renin activity (PRA), low serum and urinary levels of aldosterone and its metabolites, and a homozygous mutation in CYP11B2 that rendered the enzyme inactive. These findings, combined with the patient's history of failure to thrive in infancy, indicated type 1 aldosterone synthase deficiency."
