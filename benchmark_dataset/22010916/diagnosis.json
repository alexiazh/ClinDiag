        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by genetic analysis revealing a loss-of-function mutation in ADAM17, which aligns with the clinical features of rash, diarrhea, and failure to thrive in the affected siblings. The absence of ADAM17 expression in skin and intestinal tissues correlates with their clinical symptoms."
