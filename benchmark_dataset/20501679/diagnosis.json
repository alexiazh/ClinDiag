        "final_diagnosis": "nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism due to TSHR mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with elevated thyroid hormone levels and suppressed TSH in the absence of thyroid autoantibodies, and ultrasound revealed a thyroid gland of normal size and structure. A heterozygous mutation in the TSHR gene was identified, which led to constitutive activation of the Gs signaling pathway while simultaneously causing a near complete loss of function for the Gq/11 pathway. The absence of goiter suggested that the Gq/11 pathway is related to thyroid growth."
