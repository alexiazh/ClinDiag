        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenic-vein thrombosis, and cerebral venous thromboses. The findings on peripheral-blood smear showed no significant schistocytes and laboratory testing indicated a hemolytic process. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase and undetectable haptoglobin suggested intravascular hemolysis. Given the constellation of symptoms, including the patient's thrombosis history in relation to estrogen exposure and the presence of hemoglobinuria, the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was favored over other possible conditions."
