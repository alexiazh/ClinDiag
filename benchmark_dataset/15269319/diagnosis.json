    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital methemoglobinemia due to deficiency of erythrocytic cytochrome-b5 reductase (recessive congenital methemoglobinemia, type 1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hemoglobin M variant, methemoglobinemia due to drug exposure, hemoglobinopathies.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's persistently low SpO2 values and previous unexplained cyanosis led to suspicion of methemoglobinemia. Co-oximetry confirmed elevated methemoglobin levels, while hemoglobin electrophoresis showed normal patterns, ruling out hemoglobinopathies. The diagnosis of congenital deficiency was supported by reduced cytochrome-b5 reductase activity."
