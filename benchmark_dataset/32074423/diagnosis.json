        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's hyperglycemia met criteria for diabetes on multiple occasions, with a clinical history suggesting a non-progressive form of diabetes given her age of diagnosis and genetic predisposition. The identified genetic variant in the GCK gene correlates with the findings of mild and stable hyperglycemia, consistent with GCK-MODY."
