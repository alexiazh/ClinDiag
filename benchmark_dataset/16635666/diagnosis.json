        "final_diagnosis": "Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of HIES was supported by the patient's clinical history, including recurrent staphylococcal infections, elevated serum IgE levels of 1177 IU/mL (normal 0-29.2 IU/mL), and an elevated absolute eosinophil count. The patient's personal history of severe eczematous rash from birth and periodic infections, along with significant treatment response to immunomodulatory therapies, ultimately led to a presumptive diagnosis of HIES."
