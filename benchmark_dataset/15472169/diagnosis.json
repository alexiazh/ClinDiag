        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The child was diagnosed with congenital leptin deficiency due to being homozygous for the /H9004133G mutation, demonstrated by undetectable plasma leptin levels. Treatment with recombinant leptin therapy led to significant clinical improvements, including weight loss, normalization of metabolic parameters, correction of thyroid function, and enhanced growth, supporting the diagnosis."
