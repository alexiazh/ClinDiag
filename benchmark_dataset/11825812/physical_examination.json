Ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye depicted innumerable, small, elongated basal laminar drusen in a radial pattern, submacular fibrous tissue, hyperplasia of the RPE affecting the fovea, and peripapillary drusen. The left eye had radial drusen in a similar distribution, submacular fibrous tissue, scattered RPE hyperplasia, and peripapillary drusen.",
