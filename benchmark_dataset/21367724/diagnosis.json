        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of viral infective endocarditis (IE) was supported by the patient's clinical presentation fitting the modified Duke criteria after a third surgical intervention, despite sterile blood cultures. Extensive microbiological workup did not identify bacterial or fungal organisms, and the presence of Coxsackie B2 virus was demonstrated through culture and PCR from cardiac tissue. The lack of fever and inflammatory response, along with the subacute clinical evolution, was suggestive of atypical infectious agents such as viruses."
