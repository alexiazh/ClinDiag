Color fundus photography showed inactive subretinal fibrosis in the right eye and nonexudative type 1 macular neovascularization (MNV) in the left eye, which included scattered macular drusen sparing the fovea.",
            "changes_over_time": "Over the course of 9 years, the left eye maintained visual acuity of 20/30. A small asymptomatic subretinal hemorrhage was detected at 2.3 years after presentation but resolved within 3 months. The last evaluation, 9.3 years after presentation, showed no evidence of macular exudation in either eye."
