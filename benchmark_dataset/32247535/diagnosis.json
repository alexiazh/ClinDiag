        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by multimodal imaging indicating a shallow irregular retinal pigment epithelial elevation (SIRE) on OCT and the presence of type 1 macular neovascularization (MNV) on fluorescein angiography (FA). The index eye maintained good visual acuity and exhibited a slow growth rate of the MNV without evidence of exudation over a 9-year follow-up period, indicating a stable condition."
