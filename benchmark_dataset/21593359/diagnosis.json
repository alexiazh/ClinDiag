        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva was supported by the presence of characteristic clinical and radiographic features, including bilateral valgus deformity of the great toe, neck stiffness, and shortening of the first metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Genetic testing confirmed the recurring mutation (617G>A; R206H) in the ACVR1 gene, which is specific to this condition."
