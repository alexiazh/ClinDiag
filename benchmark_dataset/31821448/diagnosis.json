        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The mutation c.979-96 T>A in the SGK3 gene was found to be strictly segregated with patients in a heterozygous pattern and not present in normal family members. This mutation causes exon 13 skipping and an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids in the protein kinase domain of SGK3, which is hypothesized to lead to the disease."
