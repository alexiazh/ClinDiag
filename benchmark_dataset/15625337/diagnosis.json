        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited long-standing microscopic hematuria, mild proteinuria, and a family history of renal disease. Urinary examination showed dysmorphic red cells and red-cell casts, indicating a glomerular origin of hematuria. A renal biopsy demonstrated thin glomerular basement membranes. Immunofluorescence staining showed segmental reductions in the staining for type IV collagen a3 and a5 chains, consistent with being a carrier for X-linked Alport’s syndrome. The presence of widespread thin glomerular basement membranes along with specific features on biopsy suggested the diagnosis."
