        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited rapid deterioration leading to adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure, with subsequent blood cultures yielding S. sonnei. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms prior to the fever episode is notable, pointing to an atypical presentation for a typically gastrointestinal pathogen."
