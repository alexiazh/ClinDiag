    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "CHARGE syndrome with anterior pituitary hypoplasia and ectopic posterior pituitary",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Kallmann syndrome, Septo-optic dysplasia, Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of clinical features of CHARGE syndrome in two patients, supported by MRI findings showing structural abnormalities of the pituitary gland (anterior pituitary hypoplasia and ectopic posterior pituitary). Both patients demonstrated multiple hormone deficiencies along with novel CHD7 variants, suggesting a link to structural pituitary anomalies."
