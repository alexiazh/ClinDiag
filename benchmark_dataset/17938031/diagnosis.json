        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with typical symptoms of adult dermatomyositis, including skin lesions, myalgias, and proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory findings (elevated creatine kinase, positive antinuclear antibody, muscle biopsy showing inflammatory myopathy) and the chronology of findings supported the diagnosis of adult dermatomyositis. The subsequent development of lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and hypertriglyceridemia was noted without history of trauma or injections, further corroborated by skin biopsy showing focal fat necrosis and lipoatrophy."
