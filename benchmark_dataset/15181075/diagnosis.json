        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus was established based on the identification of a novel missense mutation S148W (C443G) in the HNF-1/H9252 gene, which was confirmed through genomic sequencing. Patient 1 presented with hyperglycemia and required insulin therapy from a young age, while patient 2 experienced only a transient episode of hyperglycemia. The presence of both conditions in siblings despite a normal parental genotype supports the diagnosis of diabetes through germline mosaicism in the mother."
