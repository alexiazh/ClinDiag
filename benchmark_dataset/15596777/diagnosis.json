        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of anti-GM1 antibody-negative MMN was made based on the clinical presentation of asymmetric, relapsing-remitting, purely motor weakness, as well as the presence of motor conduction block(s) demonstrated by electroneurography. Further laboratory testing ruled out infectious, neoplastic, metabolic, endocrine, or systemic inflammatory causes, and anti-GM1 antibodies were tested and found to be negative."
