        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The case revealed two novel mutations in the SRY gene and a heterozygous deletion in the enhancer of SOX9, contributing to the phenotype of sex reversal. The proband presented with primary amenorrhea and lacked puberty development, supported by abnormal hormone levels and imaging findings indicating absence of typical female structures."
