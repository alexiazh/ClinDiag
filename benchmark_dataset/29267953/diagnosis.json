        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of generalized lipodystrophy, diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatomegaly, and acanthosis nigricans in patients with a recurrent de novo heterozygous LMNA p.T10I mutation. This specific mutation was associated with distinct progeroid features and significantly worse metabolic complications compared to other progeroid syndromes."
