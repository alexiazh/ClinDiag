        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's generalized pruritus was linked to uremia due to renal failure indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, as well as substantial proteinuria and abnormal urinalysis findings (1+ blood, 3+ protein, presence of fatty casts). Renal ultrasonography revealed enlarged kidneys, consistent with an acute process, further supporting intrinsic renal disease. The renal biopsy confirmed collapsing glomerulopathy which aligned with the clinical presentation of nephrotic syndrome."
