        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex was supported by the presence of multiple tumors in the pancreas, spleen, and liver, along with the identification of genetic mutations in the TSC2 gene. Microscopic and immunohistochemical findings provided evidence for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, perivascular epithelioid cell tumors, and splenic hamartoma, which are consistent with the characteristics of this syndrome."
