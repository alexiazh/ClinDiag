Immunohistochemistry revealed positive cytokeratin (CK) and beta-catenin, suggesting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The liver tumor contained epithelioid cells, perivascular muscle-like cells, and adipocytes, with GPC-3 negative and Melan A positive, supporting a perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEcoma). The splenic tumor was a round nodule with clear boundaries, with positive staining for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), leading to a diagnosis of splenic hamartoma (myoid hamartoma).",
