        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria was supported by the patientâ€™s elevated levels of coproporphyrin I and coproporphyrin III in urine, as well as the elevated stool coproporphyrin III: coproporphyrin I ratio. Additionally, psychiatric symptoms resolved after the discontinuation of porphyrinogenic medications and glucose infusions."
