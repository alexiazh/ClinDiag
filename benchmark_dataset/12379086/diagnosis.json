    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness leading to intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to A3243G mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of diabetes mellitus, hearing loss, and symptoms consistent with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Molecular genetic analysis revealed the mitochondrial A3243G mutation, which was almost homoplasmic in smooth muscle cells. The mutation's association with intestinal pseudo-obstruction was supported by the absence of other known causes. The diagnosis was further corroborated by the patient's presentation and genetic findings."
