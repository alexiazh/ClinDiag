        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Testing results indicated combined deficiencies of 17,20-lyase and 21-hydroxylase. Genetic analysis confirmed a homozygous G539R mutation in the POR gene, consistent with POR deficiency, which was previously misdiagnosed as isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency due to overlapping clinical features."
