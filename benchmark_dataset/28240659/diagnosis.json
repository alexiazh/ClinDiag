        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of a painless soft tissue mass on the nasal tip and the biopsy pathology, which indicated metastatic squamous carcinoma. An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed multiple lesions, including the nasal tip mass, which showed high radioactivity and confirmed the metastasis from squamous lung carcinoma, validated by lung lesion biopsy."
