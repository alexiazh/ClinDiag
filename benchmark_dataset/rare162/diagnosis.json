        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient was referred for genetic counseling due to a positive first trimester screen and increased NT thickness. Despite initial low-risk noninvasive prenatal results, the anatomy ultrasound at 20 weeks revealed significant anomalies coupled with early onset growth restriction. Amniocentesis results were normal for chromosome analysis, but whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a heterozygous NIPBL pathogenic variant, confirming the diagnosis of Cornelia de Lange syndrome."
