        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with night sweats, hemoptysis, and a mass-like infiltrate in the right lower lobe. Initial imaging suggested an infectious process. A subsequent CT scan showed resolution of the infiltrate, but persistent night sweats raised concern for a lingering infection, specifically tuberculosis. The positive PPD test, combined with the clinical picture, allowed for the diagnosis of progressive primary tuberculosis."
