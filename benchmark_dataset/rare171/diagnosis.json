        "final_diagnosis": "Yellow nail syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Yellow Nail Syndrome was based on the patient's clinical presentation of thickened, yellowing nails associated with bilateral pleural effusion and non-pitting edema. The exacerbation of respiratory symptoms and pleural effusion despite antibiotic treatment and the response to prednisolone support this diagnosis, along with exclusion of other potential causes through pleural fluid analysis and imaging studies."
