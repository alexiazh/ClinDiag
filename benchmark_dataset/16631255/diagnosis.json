        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of three visible tumors in the right eye, histopathological examination showing microcellular retinoblastoma cells, and the patient's history of having a mutation in the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene. The unusual late occurrence of the retinoblastoma in a well-functioning eye, 25 years after the enucleation of the fellow eye, indicated that this was a separate entity rather than a recurrent or regressed tumor."
