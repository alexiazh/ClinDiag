        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of right breast cancer, and during routine screening mammography, a new mass was detected in the left breast, which was confirmed to be in situ ductal carcinoma. It was thought to be a new primary cancer due to the different hormone receptor profile and rarity of metastasis to the contralateral breast."
