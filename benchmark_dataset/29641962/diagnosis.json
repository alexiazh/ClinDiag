        "final_diagnosis": "Hughes–Stovin syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary artery aneurysms, Behçet’s disease, Takayasu’s arteritis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a pulmonary artery aneurysm and associated thromboembolic events suggested Hughes-Stovin syndrome. Although chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension was considered, evidence such as normal right ventricular function and the patient's weight loss indicated a systemic disease rather than just pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, negative tests for infections and absence of other clinical signs ruled out Behçet’s disease and other potential causes."
