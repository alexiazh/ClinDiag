        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including elevated TSH levels without features of hypothyroidism, multiple subcutaneous ossifications, and a family history suggestive of a genetic condition. The maternal history of similar ossifications and the lack of AHO features in the father and older brother further indicated a hereditary condition."
