            "relevant_findings": "Pronounced myotonia, slowness of movements, generalized muscle hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy was widespread but more evident in facial muscles, neck, and upper limb muscles. Shoulder girdle and biceps brachii hypertrophy responsible for humeral intrarotation attitude and elbow retraction. Myotonic stiffness hindered hand opening. Significant lid lag and convergent strabismus observed. Difficulty in tongue oscillation due to myotonia.",
            "changes_over_time": "The patient showed worsening myotonia with severe muscle stiffness exacerbated by cold temperatures, limiting daily activities. Treatment with mexiletine was discontinued after 15 days due to gastrointestinal side effects and insufficient improvement. Following a switch to flecainide, the patient reported a greater and more stable improvement in myotonia."
