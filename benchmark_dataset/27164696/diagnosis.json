        "final_diagnosis": "myotonia permanens due to a new SCN4A mutation (p.P1158L)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical phenotype and functional alterations of the P1158L mutation support the diagnosis of myotonia permanens. This includes pronounced myotonia, slowness of movements, generalized muscle hypertrophy, and a satisfactory response to flecainide treatment, while the patient had an unsatisfactory response to mexiletine due to discomfort and reduced drug sensitivity observed in vitro."
