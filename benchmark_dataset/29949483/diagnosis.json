        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with systemic inflammatory symptoms and testicular pain. Various infectious causes (such as sexually transmitted infections and brucellosis) were ruled out through negative test results and absence of relevant exposures. Tuberculosis was considered due to the patient's history but lacked supportive evidence upon evaluation. The clinical features and negative ANCA testing helped narrow down the differential to polyarteritis nodosa, which was supported by biopsy findings showing necrotizing vasculitis."
