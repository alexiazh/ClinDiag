        "final_diagnosis": "severe persistent bakers' asthma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient displayed respiratory symptoms linked to exposure to flour dust, with a skin prick test responding positively to occupational allergens. Despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast, asthma symptoms persisted, meeting the criteria for severe persistent asthma. The initiation of omalizumab treatment resulted in significant improvements in asthma control and quality of life, supported by increased FEV1 values and a negative skin prick test to allergens after treatment."
