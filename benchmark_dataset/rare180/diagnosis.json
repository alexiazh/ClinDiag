        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Congenital Gerbode defect was supported by echocardiographic findings that revealed biatrial enlargement, massive functional tricuspid insufficiency, and specifically, a defect communicating the left ventricle with the right atrium above the tricuspid valve. Additionally, intraoperative findings confirmed the presence of the defect, leading to surgical closure."
