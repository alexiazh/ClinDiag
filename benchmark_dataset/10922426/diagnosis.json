        "final_diagnosis": "Pheochromocytoma with long-QT syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Congenital long-QT syndrome, secondary long-QT syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of palpitations and had documented ventricular extrasystoles, alongside a corrected QT interval of 448 msec, raising concern for long-QT syndrome. The initial suspicion was confirmed through her clinical history of convulsions misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Subsequent elevated catecholamine levels and imaging revealed a large right adrenal tumor, leading to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which contributed to malignant arrhythmias and long-QT syndrome manifestation."
