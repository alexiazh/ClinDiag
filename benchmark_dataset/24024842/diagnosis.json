    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation caused by acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of chest pain, ST-segment elevations on the ECG, and subsequent identification of an occlusion in the right coronary artery during angiography. The acute nature of the presentation following previous episodes of unstable angina and documented coronary artery disease also contributed to the diagnosis."
