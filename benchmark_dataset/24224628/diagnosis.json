        "final_diagnosis": "High-grade B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma, as well as concurrent MYC and IGH-BCL2 rearrangements.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Burkitt's lymphoma, Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, High-grade B-cell Lymphoma, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hypercalcemia, confusion, and extensive lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic imaging indicated mediastinal and axillary lymphadenopathy and an enhancing mass in the left kidney. Elevated LDH level and unique peripheral blood smear findings suggested a hematologic malignant tumor. Immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis confirmed features suggestive of either Burkitt's lymphoma or high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 gene rearrangements."
