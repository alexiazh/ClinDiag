        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient was confirmed to have VHL by clinical criteria and VHL gene germline mutation testing after her mother was clinically diagnosed with VHL. Symptoms such as sudden onset vertigo, left tinnitus, and hearing loss were correlated with imaging findings of left intralabyrinthine hemorrhage and a small endolymphatic sac tumor (ELST). Additionally, MRI revealed hemangioblastomas of the medullary obex and thoracic spinal cord, supporting the diagnosis of VHL."
