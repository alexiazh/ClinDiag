        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of late-onset agranulocytosis was supported by the patient's progressively decreasing white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts after 19 years of continuous clozapine monotherapy, followed by recovery of WBC counts after the discontinuation of clozapine. The clinical monitoring of blood counts was essential in detecting this rare condition."
