        "final_diagnosis": "Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 22-year-old female with established Carney complex, presented with signs of Cushing's syndrome and imaging revealed a 9-cm right adrenal mass. Pathology confirmed adrenal cortical carcinoma with features such as solid growth pattern, increased mitotic activity, and unequivocal angioinvasion. Genetic analysis revealed a PRKAR1A mutation, suggesting a causal link to her condition, which was not previously associated with ACC. The patient's postoperative and follow-up imaging indicated recurrence and metastasis, supporting the diagnosis."
