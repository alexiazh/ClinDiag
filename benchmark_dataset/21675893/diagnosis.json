        "final_diagnosis": "Neurologic form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (neuro-IRIS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic meningoencephalitis, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), Meningoencephalitis caused by Herpesviridae, Acute meningoencephalitis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HIV-associated leukoencephalopathy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation of headaches, cognitive impairment, and imaging abnormalities suggested chronic meningoencephalitis. However, her well-controlled HIV infection with CD4 counts above 200, negative PCR for specific infections, and imaging findings pointed towards neuro-IRIS, particularly given the timing after ART initiation. Biopsy results showed a T-cell infiltrate without signs of opportunistic infection, supporting the diagnosis of IRIS."
