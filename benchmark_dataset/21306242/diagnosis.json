        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe back pain, refusal to walk, and hypercalcemia, which improved with hydration. Imaging studies showed diffuse osteopenia and abnormal low signal intensity in the bone marrow, suggestive of a diffuse marrow-replacing process. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was considered due to the bone pain and hypercalcemia, although peripheral blood counts were initially normal. Ultimately, a bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of B lymphoblastic leukemia, as the morphologic examination revealed a predominant population of blasts."
