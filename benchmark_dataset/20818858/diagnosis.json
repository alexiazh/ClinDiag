    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac valvular disease, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, soft-tissue sarcoma, cervicoscapular muscle atrophy, esophageal dysmotility",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was supported by the presence of ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads on an electrocardiogram, along with third-degree atrioventricular block. Emergency cardiac catheterization revealed significant stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery, which correlated with the clinical presentation of myocardial ischemia. Additionally, the patient had a history of complications related to prior treatment for Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, which included progressive cardiac valvular disease and coronary artery disease consistent with radiation-induced injuries."
