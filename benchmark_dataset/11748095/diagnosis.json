        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A novel missense mutation (Arg531Gly) in the PRKAG2 gene was identified in all affected family members, supporting its causation for the phenotype. The mutation replaced a highly conserved, positively charged arginine residue with a neutrally charged glycine. No cardiac hypertrophy was present despite severe disease onset in childhood."
