        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Alagille syndrome was supported by the infant's clinical presentation of dysmorphic facial features, chronic renal function damage, and notable genetic testing results identifying a heterozygous variation in the NOTCH2 gene. The lack of significant findings in additional tests, such as abdominal ultrasound and cardiac ultrasound, also helped to focus on Alagille syndrome as the primary diagnosis."
