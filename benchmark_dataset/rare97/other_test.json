Anterior segment exam showed white conjunctiva and 3+ anterior chamber cell, and 1+ cell in the anterior vitreous in both eyes. At 9 months follow-up, vision was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye with normal intraocular pressure. Right eye exam showed 2+ anterior chamber cell, broken posterior synechiae, a small posterior subcapsular cataract, and rare anterior vitreous cell.
