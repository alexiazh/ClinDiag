        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 9-year-old male, developed bilateral anterior uveitis following a severe episode of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) secondary to SARS-CoV-2, which culminated in multiple recurrences of inflammation, ocular hypertension, and cataracts. Initial signs included redness and photophobia in the left eye and later in the right eye, which aligned with the clinical findings during the follow-up examinations that showed anterior chamber cell presence and complications like broken posterior synechiae and cataracts."
