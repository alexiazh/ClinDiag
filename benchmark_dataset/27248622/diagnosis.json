    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "May–Thurner syndrome with recurrent deep-vein thrombosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, structural or anatomical anomalies, hereditary thrombophilia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of May–Thurner syndrome was supported by imaging studies showing compression of the left external iliac vein by the crossing internal iliac artery and continued recurrent thrombosis in the left leg despite anticoagulation therapy. The patient's history and repeated occurrences of clots prompted thorough investigation to rule out other factors such as thrombophilia and anatomical abnormalities."
