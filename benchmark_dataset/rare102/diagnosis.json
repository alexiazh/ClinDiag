        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy was based on the patient's clinical presentation of progressive dizziness with a history of rotatory episodes, associated symptoms of oscillopsia, and the results from various diagnostic tests, including an MRI showing age-related cerebral atrophy, and abnormalities in vestibular testing. The lumbar puncture revealed albumin cytological dissociation with no evidence of infection or autoimmune disorders, and caloric testing confirmed the diagnosis."
