        "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with dizziness for the last 1.5 years. Initially, the dizziness was rotatory, episodic, moderate to severe in intensity, and aggravated by postural changes. Over the following weeks, it developed into a near-continuous symptom, with episodic postural and positional aggravation, relieved by lying down. This was associated with swaying, 'turning of his vision,' and blurring upon walking or moving his head, presumably oscillopsia. The patient's unsteadiness progressed to the point where he could not stand or walk.",
