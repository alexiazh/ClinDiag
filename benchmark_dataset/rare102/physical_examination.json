            "relevant_findings": "The patient presented as well-groomed with a cheerful personality. Ocular examination showed square wave jerks during fixation, restricted up-gaze with persistent gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus bilaterally, broken pursuit, slow dysmetric horizontal saccades, and abnormal optokinetic nystagmus bilaterally. Extrapyramidal examination revealed mild asymmetrical cog-wheeling and rigidity of both upper limbs (right more than left) and bradykinesia (right more than left). Cerebellar examination showed dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia (right more than left), with impaired tandem walk and swaying towards the right side. The patient exhibited a broad-based cautious gait. Vestibular examination disclosed abnormal dynamic visual acuity and head impulse tests on both sides. Other cranial, sensory, and motor examinations were normal for his age with no postural drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.",
            "changes_over_time": "The patient initially experienced dizziness that progressed over 1.5 years, worsening to a point where he could not stand or walk. Slowness of activity developed three months prior to presentation."
