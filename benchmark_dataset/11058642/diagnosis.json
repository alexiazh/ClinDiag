    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Proximal interruption of the right pulmonary artery",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Simple pulmonary hypoplasia, hypogenetic lung syndrome, Swyer-James syndrome, post-inflammatory changes and fibrosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by imaging findings including substantial volume loss in the right hemithorax, absence of the mediastinal portion of the right main pulmonary artery, and the presence of collateral circulation through intercostal arteries. The history of hemoptysis in the patient was also compatible with the radiographic diagnosis. Differential diagnoses were considered based on similar radiographic presentations but were ruled out based on specific findings."
