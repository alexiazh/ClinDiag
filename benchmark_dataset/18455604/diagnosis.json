        "final_diagnosis": "Aortic dissection associated with Loeysâ€“Dietz syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, nonsyndromic familial thoracic aortic aneurysm with dissections",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of family members dying from arterial dissection at a young age, physical exam findings including mild kyphosis and hypertelorism, imaging results demonstrating a widened mediastinum and dilatation of the proximal aorta with a luminal flap, and genetic testing confirming a mutation in TGFBR1 indicative of Loeys-Dietz syndrome."
