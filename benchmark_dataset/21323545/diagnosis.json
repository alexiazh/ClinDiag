        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of malignant cells in the urine, cystoscopic findings of papillary projections in the prostatic urethra, and the pathological examination revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma led to the diagnosis. Additionally, negative results for PSA and PSAP and positive results for CDX2 and CK20 supported the conclusion of urothelial-type adenocarcinoma arising in the prostatic urethra."
