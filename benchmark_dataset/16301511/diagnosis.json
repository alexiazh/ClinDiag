        "differential_diagnosis": "Multiple sclerosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited CNS demyelinating disease with features satisfying the diagnostic criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Key evidence included demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy noted on EMG, increased T2-hyperintense lesions in brain MRI, and CSF analysis revealing increased protein and oligoclonal IgG bands. The presence of a Gd-enhancing lesion and the patient's progressive symptoms supported the association between CMT1X and MS."
