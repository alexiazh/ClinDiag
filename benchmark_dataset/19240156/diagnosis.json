        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the identification of a novel heterozygous 19-nucleotide duplication mutation in the IGF1R gene, which led to haploinsufficiency of the IGF1R protein due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Family history of short stature and clinical findings indicating growth retardation further supported the diagnosis."
