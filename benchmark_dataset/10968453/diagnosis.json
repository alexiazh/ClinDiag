        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome was made based on the presence of significant physical and behavioral characteristics, including neonatal hypotonia, mid-childhood obesity, food-seeking behavior, and difficulties in late childhood. Methylation studies confirmed the absence of the paternally donated imprinting center on chromosome 15q11â€“13, which is indicative of the syndrome."
