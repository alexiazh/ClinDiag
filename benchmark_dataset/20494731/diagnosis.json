        "final_diagnosis": "primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "metastatic serous ovarian carcinoma, primary colon carcinoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation of rectal bleeding and altered bowel habits suggested colorectal cancer; however, the biopsy showed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma with atypical mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry raised the possibility of a gynaecological cancer, leading to the diagnosis of primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma after pathological review and additional surgical findings."
