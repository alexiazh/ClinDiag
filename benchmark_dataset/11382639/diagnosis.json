        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on a review of clinical records and systemic manifestations in patients with eyelid basal cell carcinoma, which included multiple basal cell carcinomas, family history of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, and specific systemic features such as frontal bossing, palmar pits, and odontogenic keratocysts. The presence of these key features fulfilled diagnostic criteria for Gorlin-Goltz syndrome."
