        "final_diagnosis": "Ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella infection (Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the isolation of a ceftriaxone-resistant strain of Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium from a 12-year-old boy who presented with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The strain displayed resistance to multiple antibiotics and was found to be indistinguishable from isolates obtained from cattle during a local outbreak. The patient's history suggested a likely acquisition through contact with cattle, correlating the strain's genomic characteristics with those of the bacteria found in the livestock."
