        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included progressive insomnia, psychiatric symptoms, and motor dysfunction consistent with neurodegenerative conditions. Negative tests for reversible causes, a significant hyponatremia associated with appropriated ADH secretion, and the later identification of an anti-VGKC antibody prompted initial treatment for suspected autoimmune etiologies. However, the progression of symptoms aligned with features of prion disease and confirmed by genetic testing and immunohistochemical studies leading to the final diagnosis of fatal familial insomnia (FFI)."
