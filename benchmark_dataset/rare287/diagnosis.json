        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was supported by the patient's history of respiratory distress requiring intubation and ongoing oxygen support, episodes of pneumonia, and pulmonary findings such as ground-glass opacities on CT. Additionally, the patient's prolonged dependency on ventilatory support and the presence of comorbidities like atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were relevant to the diagnosis."
