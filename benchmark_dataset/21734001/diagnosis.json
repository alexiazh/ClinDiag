        "differential_diagnosis": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, connective tissue disorders, and other rare genetic conditions associated with intrinsic skeletal defects.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with multiple vertebral compression fractures and back pain, alongside a decreased lumbar spine Z-score of -2.5. Normal bone marrow biopsy and exclusion of common secondary causes through biochemical tests, alongside normal hearing and sclerae, supported the presumptive diagnosis of IJO. The patient responded positively to treatment, showing an improvement in height growth and Z-score after therapy."
