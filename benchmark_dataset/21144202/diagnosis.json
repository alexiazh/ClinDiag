        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gout was established based on the presence of large quantities of needle-shaped crystals seen in the knee joint aspirate, which were negatively birefringent under polarising light microscopy. Supporting findings included elevated uric acid levels, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), along with the characteristic joint effusions and acute pain."
