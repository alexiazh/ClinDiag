        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of HCMV retinitis was supported by the presence of HCMV in the blood and the occurrence of clinical symptoms consistent with retinitis in both patients who had advanced HIV infection. Emergence of drug-resistant HCMV strains during treatment and the ineffectiveness of previous therapies further reinforced the diagnosis."
