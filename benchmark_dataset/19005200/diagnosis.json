        "final_diagnosis": "Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis due to a mediastinal tumor, probably thymoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's amnestic syndrome, evidenced by profound anterograde amnesia and MRI findings showing symmetric hyperintensity in the medial temporal lobes, suggested limbic system dysfunction. The absence of typical features for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, traumatic brain injury, HSV encephalitis, and other potential causes, led to the conclusion of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis likely associated with the mediastinal tumor."
