        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 3-year-old boy with a history of tuberous sclerosis, presented with an enhancing pineal region mass. MRI findings included multiple cortical tubers and subependymal nodules, which are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis. The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of SEGA. Despite the atypical location of the tumor, the association with tuberous sclerosis and the MRI characterization led to this conclusion."
