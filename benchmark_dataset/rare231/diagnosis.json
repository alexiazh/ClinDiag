        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of 46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis was supported by clinical presentations of hirsutism, deep voice, and clitoromegaly, alongside laboratory findings including elevated follicle stimulating hormone and testosterone levels. The cytogenetic analysis revealed a 46,XY karyotype, and pathology post-orchiectomy showed testes dysgenesis. The presence of a primordial uterus and hypoplastic testes on imaging corroborated the diagnosis."
