        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CEP was supported by the infant's history of severe sunlight-induced blistering, elevated plasma and urinary porphyrins, and chromosomal analysis showing homozygosity for URO-synthase C73R mutation. The combination of these findings, along with the clinical presentation, confirmed the deficiency of uroporphyrinogen III synthase activity."
