        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute kidney injury, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The clinical features suggested hemodynamic compromise, possibly due to volume depletion and NSAID usage, but the findings on urinalysis pointed towards intrinsic renal disease. The eventual diagnosis of atypical hemolytic–uremic syndrome was supported by laboratory tests indicating hemolysis and the presence of microangiopathic changes on kidney biopsy. Genetic testing identified a CFHR3 mutation, consistent with atypical hemolytic–uremic syndrome."
