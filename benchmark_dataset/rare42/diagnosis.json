        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Familial cold urticaria was supported by whole exome sequencing that identified a heterozygous variation in the NLRP3 gene, which was validated as pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. The clinical presentation of recurrent fever episodes, conjunctival congestion, and urticarial-like rash, along with laboratory findings of elevated leukocyte counts and inflammatory markers, further substantiated the diagnosis."
