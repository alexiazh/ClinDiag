        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Hypothyroidism due to TPO mutations",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pendred syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with congenital hypothyroidism and goiter, alongside bilateral moderate hearing loss. Initially suspected to have Pendred syndrome, further genetic analysis revealed a monoallelic mutation in SLC26A4/PDS and compound heterozygous mutations in TPO, which are consistent with goitrous hypothyroidism but not PS, as the hearing impairment was moderate rather than severe."
