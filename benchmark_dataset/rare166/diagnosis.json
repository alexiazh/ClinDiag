        "final_diagnosis": "Atrial standstill",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of atrial standstill was supported by the findings of no observed atrial contraction on fluoroscopy, as well as the absence of A-waves during electrophysiological examination. Additionally, the patient's family history of atrial standstill, coupled with the identified genetic mutation (frameshift mutation in LMNA), further supports the diagnosis."
