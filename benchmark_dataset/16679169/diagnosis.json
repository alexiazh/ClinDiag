        "differential_diagnosis": "possible acute diverticulitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hereditary angioedema type 1 was confirmed by laboratory tests showing reduced total haemolytic complement activity, low C1 inhibitor levels, and low C4 levels, which were consistent with the patient's symptoms and medical history. The presence of an expanding multiloculated mass adjacent to the caecal fundus suggested potential gastrointestinal involvement, but a follow-up scan showed complete resolution, further supporting the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema rather than an acute surgical condition."
