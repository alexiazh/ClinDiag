            "11β-hydroxylase deficiency",

            "Deoxycorticosterone-producing tumor",
            "Excess licorice ingestion"
        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited classic symptoms of AME including hypertension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, suppressed plasma renin activity, and undetectable aldosterone. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the HSD11B2 gene, confirmed by in vitro expression studies showing no enzyme activity, which corroborated the phenotype consistent with AME."
