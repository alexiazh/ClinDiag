        "final_diagnosis": "Perforation of the sigmoid colon by a toothpick with an associated arterioenteric fistula and diverticulitis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Ischemic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, colon carcinoma, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of rectal bleeding, syncope, abdominal pain, and leg pain led to the consideration of various differential diagnoses. Key findings included the history of diverticulosis, abdominal imaging results showing diverticulitis, and the presence of an arterioenteric fistula suggested by simultaneous gastrointestinal bleeding and diminished pulses in the right leg. The diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively with the discovery of a perforated diverticulum due to a toothpick."
