        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by echocardiography revealing left ventricular dilation, decreased contractility, and cardiomegaly. Respiratory-chain enzyme analysis indicated deficiencies in complexes I and IV, suggesting a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation. Additionally, histopathological findings showed significant endocardial fibroelastosis and diffuse myocyte vacuolization."
