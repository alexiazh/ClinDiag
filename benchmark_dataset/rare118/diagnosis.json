        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease was supported by clinical findings of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and a biopsy showing histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. The history of intermittent fever and elevated LDH levels in the past, along with negative tests for infections such as EBV, CMV, and others, further supported the diagnosis."
