        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by invasive angiography confirming a fistula between an unroofed first septal perforator and the left ventricular cavity. Additional diagnostics included CTCA showing a large caliber first septal perforating artery with probable communication with the LV cavity, and echocardiographic findings indicative of significant valvular and outflow tract issues."
