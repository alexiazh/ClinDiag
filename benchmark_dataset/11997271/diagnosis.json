        "final_diagnosis": "in-stent restenosis (ISR)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The study's results indicated minimal intimal hyperplasia at the 6-month follow-up with a low rate of angiographic restenosis (13.3%). However, by the 12-month follow-up, 61.5% of patients exhibited angiographic restenosis, suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of the QuaDS-QP2 stent was not maintained over time. The cases of restenosis occurred in lesions that were inadequately covered by stents, contributing to the diagnosis of ISR."
