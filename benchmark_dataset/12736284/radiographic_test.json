On the third hospital day, consolidation in the right upper lobe had improved, but persistent interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions were present. On the sixth hospital day, persistent right-upper-lobe consolidation was observed with worsening diffuse interstitial opacities and unchanged pleural effusions. Finally, on the day of discharge, consolidations had resolved with small bilateral pleural effusions remaining."
