    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Severe community-acquired pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, probably due to bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Legionella pneumophila infection, atypical pneumonia, bronchial obstruction, other infectious pneumonias.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's high fever, leukocytosis, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural effusions on chest radiographs suggested community-acquired pneumonia. The clinical presentation was consistent with severe pneumonia, likely from infective causes, with features prompting consideration of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. The definitive diagnosis was established through an open-lung biopsy revealing organizing pneumonia with bronchiolitis obliterans."
