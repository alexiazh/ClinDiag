        "final_diagnosis": "Thymoma (types B2 and B3, clinical stage 4A), with associated cellular and humoral immunodeficiency (Good’s syndrome), autoimmune enteropathy, and pure red-cell aplasia.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of recurrent diarrhea, combined with findings from biopsy specimens indicating autoimmune enteropathy, further correlated with the clinical history of thymoma and associated immunodeficiency that suggests Good’s syndrome. Diagnostic procedures revealed evidence consistent with autoimmune enteropathy, reflecting the disordered immune response often associated with thymoma."
