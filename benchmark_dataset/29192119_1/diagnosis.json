        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had fluctuating serum potassium levels and a discovered adrenal mass during a chest CT scan. Initial evaluation considered primary hyperaldosteronism but was dismissed due to normal serum aldosterone levels and normal aldosterone-to-renin ratio. Adrenal venous sampling later showed markedly increased aldosterone levels on the left, confirming the diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma. Surgical resection led to immediate resolution of hypertension and improvement of symptoms."
