        "final_diagnosis": "Helicobacter cinaedi bloodstream infection with multifocal cellulitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Blood cultures signaled positive for H. cinaedi after 48 hours of incubation, with curved gram-negative bacilli observed on Gram stain. The clinical presentation included recurrent multifocal cellulitis, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers, which fit the profile of H. cinaedi infection. The rash and arthritis associated with the infection is characterized as multifocal and noncontiguous, likely a result of cutaneous seeding from hematogenous spread."
