        "differential_diagnosis": "HIV-associated nephropathy, infection-related immune complexâ€“mediated glomerulonephritis, infiltrative-type kidney disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included a history of injection-drug use, facial droop, dysarthria, kidney failure, and findings suggesting a fungal brain abscess, which were all taken into consideration. The renal biopsy confirmed AA amyloidosis associated with heroin use, and histologic examination of the brain lesion identified a mucormycosis infection."
