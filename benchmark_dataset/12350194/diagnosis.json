        "differential_diagnosis": "Still disease (systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presenting symptoms, including daily fevers, cutaneous ulcers, and features consistent with vasculitis, led to the consideration of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The absence of arthritis, lymphadenopathy, and other typical features of Still disease, along with skin biopsies revealing vasculitis of medium-sized arteries, ultimately supported the diagnosis of PAN."
