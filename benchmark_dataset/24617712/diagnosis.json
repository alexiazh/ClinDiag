        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Somatic DICER1 mutations were identified in three cases of DTC arising in individuals with germline DICER1 mutations, all with a medical history of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). The mutations affected highly conserved amino acid residues within the DICER1 ribonuclease IIIb domain, thought to contribute to DTC development."
