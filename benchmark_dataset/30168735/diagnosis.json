        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) was supported by the patient's chronic headaches, loss of visual acuity, optic nerve edema, and high ICP measurements from lumbar punctures (38 mm Hg and 29 mm Hg). Pharmacological treatment was initiated, and subsequent normalization of ICP was recorded after bariatric surgery to manage the patient's morbid obesity."
