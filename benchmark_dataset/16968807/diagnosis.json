        "final_diagnosis": "congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) involving GH, PRL, and TSH",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with undetectable serum levels of GH, PRL, and TSH, alongside confirmed hypoplasia of the anterior pituitary gland. Genetic analysis identified a novel homozygous mutation (S179R) in the POU1F1 gene, which is associated with functional deficiencies in these hormones."
