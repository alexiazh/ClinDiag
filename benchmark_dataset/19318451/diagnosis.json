        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The elder sister presented with elevated TSH levels, subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment consistent with Pendred syndrome. The younger sister exhibited congenital goiter, elevated free T3 and T4 with unsuppressed TSH, and sensorineural hearing impairment, supporting a diagnosis of resistance to thyroid hormone. Molecular genetic testing confirmed the presence of both conditions in the younger sister."
