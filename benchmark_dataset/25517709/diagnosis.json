        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The identification of pulmonary nodules on imaging studies, alongside a history of Crohn's disease and a lack of acute respiratory symptoms, led to the final diagnosis. The previous normal pulmonary function tests and subsequent development of restrictive lung disease indicated a chronic process. The lung nodules exhibited central necrosis, suggesting a non-malignant etiology. The resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms coupled with the persistent pulmonary dysfunction pointed towards pulmonary Crohn's disease rather than an infectious or malignant process."
