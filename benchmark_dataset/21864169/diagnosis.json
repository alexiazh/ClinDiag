        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient has a clinical diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), supported by genetic testing revealing a deletion in the TSC2 gene. Serial imaging showed a complex cyst in the kidney that underwent notable changes, including an enlarging solid component, which raised concerns for a neoplasm. Findings suggested the likelihood of renal-cell carcinoma, particularly due to exceptional characteristics of the cyst that were atypical for TSC-related cysts."
