        "final_diagnosis": "Borna virus encephalitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Borna virus encephalitis was confirmed by a positive qRT-PCR result from CSF collected on day 8, and initial CSF analysis indicated blood-brain barrier disruption. Negative PCR results for other viral infections (herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus) and absence of serological indicators for Lyme disease or autoimmune encephalitis further supported the diagnosis."
