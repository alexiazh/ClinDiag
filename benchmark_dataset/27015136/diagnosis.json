        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the distinct morphological characteristics of hepatic adenomas, classified as HNF1-α inactivated adenomas, showing macrovesicular steatosis and loss of liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) expression. Fibrolamellar carcinomas showed classical histological features different from the adenomas, with loss of LFABP being a consistent finding in both conditions, indicating HNF1-α inactivation as an important pathway in their pathogenesis."
