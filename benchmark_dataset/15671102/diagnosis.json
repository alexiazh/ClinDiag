        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of childhood hypophosphatasia was made at 1.4 years of age based on clinical findings including pectus excavatum, large anterior fontanel, rachitic skeletal changes, and low serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Genetic testing revealed compound heterozygosity for a moderate mutation (E174K) and a de novo severe mutation (M45I), which completely abolished alkaline phosphatase activity, supporting the diagnosis."
