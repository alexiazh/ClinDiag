        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by a peripheral blood smear that revealed intracellular parasite forms consistent with Babesia spp., and PCR testing confirmed the presence of Babesia divergens–like DNA. The patient had multiple risk factors, including asplenia and recent red blood cell transfusions, which were suspected sources of infection."
