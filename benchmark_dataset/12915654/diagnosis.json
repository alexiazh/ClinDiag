        "final_diagnosis": "Recurrent Familial Hypocalcemia due to Germline Mosaicism for an Activating Mutation of the Calcium-Sensing Receptor Gene (F788L mutation)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The family's two affected siblings were heterozygous for a novel F788L mutation in the CASR gene, with the mother being mosaic for the mutation. Key biochemical findings included hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, low serum PTH levels, and an increased urinary calcium/creatinine ratio in the affected siblings. Functional analysis demonstrated the mutant CASR had a leftward shift in the MAPK response to extracellular calcium, indicating increased activity."
