        "final_diagnosis": "metastatic parathyroid carcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 39-year-old man with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism and recurrent hypercalcemia, showed elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels that were refractory to typical treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, and calcium receptor agonists. Histological analysis confirmed parathyroid carcinoma after reoperation. After failed medical management for recurrent hypercalcemia, the addition of denosumab resulted in successful control of hypercalcemia, indicating the effectiveness of denosumab in this clinical scenario."
