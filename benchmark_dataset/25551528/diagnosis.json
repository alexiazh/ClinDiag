        "final_diagnosis": "POEMS syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), Multiple sclerosis, Sarcoidosis, Neoplastic processes, Vasculitis, Amyloidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome was supported by the presence of polyneuropathy, monoclonal plasma-cell proliferation (IgA lambda monoclonal gammopathy), elevated plasma VEGF, splenomegaly, and pitting edema. The absence of conduction blocks, temporal dispersion in nerve-conduction studies, and specific patterns of weakness and reflexes further indicated POEMS syndrome rather than CIDP."
