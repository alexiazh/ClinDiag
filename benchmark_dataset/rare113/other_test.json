            "findings": "The tumor was composed of two components: non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). LCNEC showed a nested and trabecular pattern in the background of the desmoplastic stroma. Focal rosette formation was observed. Tumor cells had a moderate amount of cytoplasm, large pleomorphic nuclei, and 1–2 conspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the SCC part was positive for p63 and negative for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin-A, CD56, and INSM1). The LCNEC part was focally reactive with synaptophysin, CD56, and INSM1, but negative for p63 and chromogranin-A. Both SCC and LCNEC parts were diffusely positive for Epstein–Barr encoding region in-situ hybridization.",
