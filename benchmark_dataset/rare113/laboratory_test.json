The SCC part was positive for p63 and negative for synaptophysin, chromogranin-A, CD56, and insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1). The LCNEC part was focally reactive with synaptophysin, CD56, and INSM1, but negative for p63 and chromogranin-A. Both parts were diffusely positive for Epsteinâ€“Barr encoding region in-situ hybridization.",
