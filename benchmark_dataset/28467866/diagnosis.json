        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis was supported by imaging findings of destruction of the L4 and L5 vertebrae with chronic granulomatous inflammation and positive serologic testing for coccidioidal antibodies. The patient's travel history to endemic areas for coccidioidomycosis and prior pneumonia symptoms were also motivating factors in considering this diagnosis."
