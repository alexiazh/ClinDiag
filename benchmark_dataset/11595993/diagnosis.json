        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of primary HLH was fulfilled according to Histiocyte Society diagnostic guidelines, characterized by fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypo-fibrinogenemia, and hemophagocytosis observed in bone marrow examinations, without evidence of malignancy. The presence of significant infections associated with HLH and the clinical presentation indicated a profound immunosuppression common in HLH patients."
