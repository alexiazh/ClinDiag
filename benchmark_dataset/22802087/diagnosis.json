        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital hyperinsulinism due to mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (ruled out)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "In the three cases described, genetic sequencing revealed mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A associated with congenital hyperinsulinism. Case 1 had persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with a novel HNF1A mutation, Case 2 had diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism with another HNF1A mutation, and Case 3 presented with similar symptoms but developed additional complications which were later tied to a known MODY1 mutation in HNF4A. Abnormalities consistent with hyperinsulinism were identified in all three cases, leading to their diagnosis."
