        "final_diagnosis": "Cushing’s syndrome due to a well-differentiated, low-grade thymic neuroendocrine tumor with corticotropin secretion",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary aldosteronism, Cushing’s syndrome, ectopic corticotropin secretion",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the clinical findings of hypertension, hypokalemia, and elevated cortisol levels leading to the discovery of a thymic neuroendocrine tumor causing ectopic corticotropin secretion. Imaging studies, including a PET scan, revealed a nodule in the mediastinum that was subsequently confirmed to be the source of the abnormal hormone production."
