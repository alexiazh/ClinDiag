        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Acute neurological presentation in a previously healthy child with fever, high inflammatory markers, sepsis physiology, and hyponatraemia suggested bacterial meningoencephalitis. Catecholamine-resistant shock with hyperpigmentation prompted investigation for adrenal insufficiency. The rapid neurological recovery with a normal CT scan after treatment indicated cerebral oedema was due to hyponatraemia and adrenal insufficiency."
