    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "sarcoma of the pulmonary artery",
        "differential_diagnosis": "acute pulmonary thromboembolism, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, vasculitis (giant-cell arteritis, Takayasu's arteritis, Beh√ßet's disease), tumor embolus, primary tumors of the pulmonary artery",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by imaging studies revealing a mass occluding the pulmonary artery and associated pleuritic pain and dyspnea. The clinical presentation, imaging characteristics (gadolinium enhancement), and partial improvement after thrombolytic therapy indicated an underlying sarcoma. The patient's age and presentation ruled out several other conditions. An intravascular biopsy confirmed the presence of a myxoid spindle-cell tumor."
