        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Sam has experienced multiple episodes of acute otitis media since the age of 5 months, characterized by pain and the presence of pus behind an immobile tympanic membrane when symptomatic. His normal tympanic membrane between episodes and the fact that he has been on prophylactic antibiotics with no further episodes indicate a significant problem with recurrent ear infections, leading to the final diagnosis."
