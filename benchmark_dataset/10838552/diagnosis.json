    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "synchronous primary centrally located squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and esophageal adenocarcinoma with Barrett epithelium",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with significant history of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, chronic respiratory dysfunction, and symptoms indicative of esophageal carcinoma. Diagnostic imaging and rigid bronchoscopy revealed a squamous cell tumor in the lung and an adenocarcinoma in the distal esophagus. Preoperative assessments confirmed no metastasis from either tumor and ruled out extrathoracic involvement, supporting the decision for a combined surgical approach."
