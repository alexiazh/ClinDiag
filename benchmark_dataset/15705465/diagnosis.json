        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The combination of hair loss and increased creatine phosphokinase levels raised suspicion of hypothyroidism. Confirmatory tests showed elevated TSH and low serum thyroxin, leading to the diagnosis. Treatment with thyroxine resulted in improvement of hypertension, renal function, cholesterol levels, and hair loss."
