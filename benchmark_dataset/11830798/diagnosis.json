        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of gram-positive bacilli as P. acnes through direct bacterial examination of the liquid mass in the superior mediastinum. The patient's symptoms improved with targeted antibiotic treatment, and there was no evidence of infection by other pathogens like Aspergillus species, which were ruled out through comprehensive testing. The patient was also under prophylactic therapy, which included TMP-SMZ to which P. acnes was resistant."
