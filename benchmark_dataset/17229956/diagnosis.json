        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a flat, pigmented lesion that had changed in characteristics over time, including itching, elevation, and bleeding. A punch biopsy previously reported an atypical Spitz tumor. Upon re-excision, the pathological examination showed a superficial spreading malignant melanoma with certain histologic features, including vertical growth phase and dermal mitoses. A sentinel lymph node biopsy subsequently confirmed metastatic melanoma in one of the nodes."
