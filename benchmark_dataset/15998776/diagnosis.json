    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Severe congenital hyperinsulinism caused by a mutation in the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a homozygous missense mutation, H259R, in the Kir6.2 subunit leading to channel non-functionality and impaired trafficking. The patient's presentation included macrosomia and severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, confirmed by genetic analysis and cellular studies demonstrating decreased surface expression and abolition of KATP currents."
