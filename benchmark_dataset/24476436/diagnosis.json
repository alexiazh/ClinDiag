        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included abdominal pain, night sweats, and lymphadenopathy. The CT scans showed mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, which alongside the history of erythema nodosum and the patient's background increased suspicion for sarcoidosis. The biopsy revealed non-necrotizing granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis."
