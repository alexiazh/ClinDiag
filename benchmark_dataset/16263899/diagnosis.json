        "final_diagnosis": "acute intermittent porphyria",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria was based on clinical presentations such as intense abdominal pain, convulsions, and elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) levels in four patients. The successful treatment with intravenous cimetidine, alongside clinical improvement and normalization of PBG levels over time, supports the diagnosis."
