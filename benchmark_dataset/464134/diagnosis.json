        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients exhibited recurrent mood swings, periods of mania or hypomania, and behavioral changes that were indicative of manic-depressive illness, which was often overlooked due to their mental retardation. Close observation and thorough history-taking, including insights from family members, helped clarify the diagnosis despite initial attributions of symptoms to mental retardation."
