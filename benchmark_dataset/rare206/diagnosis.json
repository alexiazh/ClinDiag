        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Hemoglobin E disease was supported by laboratory findings of pancytopenia, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and decreased reticulocyte count, along with the blood smear suggesting hemolysis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed 79% HbA2 + E and a band at the HbE zone, confirming the presence of Hemoglobin E."
