        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients exhibited hypocalcemia with inappropriately normal PTH levels, which led to the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism. Both patients had antibodies that activated the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) but did not cause irreversible destruction of parathyroid glands, as evidenced by one patient having a normal parathyroid gland during surgery and the other experiencing spontaneous remission of hypoparathyroidism."
