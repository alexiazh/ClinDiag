        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of acute metabolic episodes leading to hemiplegia and hemiparesis, which were controlled by a low-protein regimen, consistent with propionic acidemia. Additionally, a brain MRI was conducted to evaluate motor dysfunction and cognitive deficiency, particularly for anomalies linked to propionic acidemia, but it did not reveal significant abnormalities."
