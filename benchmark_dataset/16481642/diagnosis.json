        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The absence of a marked eye deviation and the patient's history of healthy eyes throughout childhood imply acute visual loss due to retinal detachment, confirmed by leukokoria, total retinal detachment, and abnormal blood vessels. The findings were most consistent with retinoblastoma, particularly the atypical diffuse infiltrating type, due to the lack of an obvious mass and the specific nature of the retinal changes observed."
