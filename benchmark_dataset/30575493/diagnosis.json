        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and MRI findings suggested granulomatosis with polyangiitis, particularly due to the unusual appearance of the medial rectus muscle on imaging, indicative of necrosis. Additionally, the patient's history of glucocorticoid-refractory symptoms and sialadenitis further supported this diagnosis. The diagnosis was confirmed through an orbital biopsy that showed necrotizing granulomatous myositis."
