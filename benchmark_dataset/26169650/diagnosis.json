        "final_diagnosis": "Left ventricular to left atrial fistula due to traumatic mitral annular disruption",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed intact mitral leaflets but marked disruption and fistulization of the anterior mitral annulus, characterized by a 9 Ã— 7 mm irregular opening. The Doppler signal indicated mitral regurgitation. Given the history of trauma from a fall and absence of cardiovascular symptoms, the findings suggest an acquired defect rather than a primary valvular disease."
