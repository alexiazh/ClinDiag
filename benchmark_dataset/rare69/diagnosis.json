        "final_diagnosis": "Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency was supported by significantly elevated blood lactate and ammonia levels, persistent metabolic acidosis, and the identification of a compound heterozygous mutation in the PC gene confirmed by trio-whole exome sequencing. Additionally, the patient's clinical presentation, including convulsions and irritability, alongside the biochemical findings indicating a genetic metabolic disease, led to the final diagnosis."
