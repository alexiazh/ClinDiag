        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of symptomatic lactic acidosis was based on the identification of elevated venous plasma lactate levels (median 12-fold greater than normal), clinical symptoms including abdominal pain and weight loss, and histopathologic findings of hepatic steatosis. The syndrome was linked to prior exposure to nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), with a notable number presenting during hospitalization showing rapid progression to multiple-organ failure."
