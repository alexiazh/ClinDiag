    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. M exhibits classic symptoms of PTSD, such as recurrent intrusive thoughts and nightmares about the motor vehicle collision, difficulty concentrating, pervasive anxiety, and avoidance of driving. His symptoms were triggered by multiple traumatic events, including a life-threatening incident, which aligns with the criteria for PTSD as described in the DSM-IV. Despite some skepticism towards the diagnosis, the presentation is consistent with an acute stress response that has not resolved and has led to considerable distress."
