        "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with transient respiratory distress requiring hospitalization after birth. Within the first days of life, multiple episodes of bradycardia, desaturation, and cyanosis were observed. Extensive generalized hypotonia and gastroesophageal reflux developed, along with intermittent stridor and apnea/hypopnea due to severe laryngomalacia. At 4.5 months, abnormal hyperextension movements and desaturation were noted, with significant neurological deterioration within one month. By 10 months, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for pneumopathy and subsequently suffered from coma and multiple febrile seizures, leading to death 4 days later from cardio-respiratory arrest.",
