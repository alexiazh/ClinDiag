        "differential_diagnosis": "Partial Complex Seizures",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder, such as recurrent nightmares and intrusive thoughts about combat experiences. Further evaluation, including an EEG, revealed independent bilateral temporal epileptiform sharp waves, leading to the consideration of partial complex seizures as a differential diagnosis. The positive response to carbamazepine treatment suggested a relationship between the seizures and the patient's symptoms."
