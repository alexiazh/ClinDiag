        "final_diagnosis": "Ketotic hypoglycemia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ketotic hypoglycemia was based on the occurrence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.0 mmol/liter) and pronounced ketonuria after fasting, along with evidence that the patient's glucose production and lipolysis rates were normal. The patient showed an increased level of 2-hydroxybutyrate and a reduced capacity to use ketone bodies as an energy substrate, leading to increased peripheral glucose consumption and resulting hypoglycemia."
