        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of thyroid dysgenesis was supported by genetic findings of heterozygous mutations in both the NKX2.5 gene and the PAX8 promoter region, which are known to be involved in thyroid development. Neonatal screening indicated congenital hypothyroidism, evidenced by elevated TSH levels and low serum T3 and T4 levels. Ultrasound suggested athyreosis and lack of significant thyroid tissue, confirming the absence of a functional thyroid gland."
