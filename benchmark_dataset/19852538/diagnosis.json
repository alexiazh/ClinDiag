        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's progressive binasal hemianopia was attributed to compression of the optic chiasm by a vascular loop of the right proximal ACA, as documented by MR imaging. The absence of other lesions and causes further supported this diagnosis. Following microvascular decompression (MVD), the patient's visual field deficit improved significantly."
