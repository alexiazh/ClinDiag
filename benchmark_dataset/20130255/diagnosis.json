        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was supported by the clinical features of dyspnea, pulmonary hypertension confirmed by echocardiography, and the characteristic radiologic findings of bilateral hilar adenopathy and increased interstitial markings. The patient's lack of response to vasodilators and the patterns seen on imaging indicated that typical treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension might exacerbate her condition."
