Catheterization showed a very minimal leak in the apex of the newly created wide interventricular septum, low right ventricle pressure, and a mild pulmonary stenosis. Right and left ventricular outflow were unobstructed.",
            "changes_over_time": "At the end of the fifth postoperative year, the patient developed exertion-related dyspnea, and echocardiography showed progression of the tricuspid valve incompetence, a pulmonary stenosis producing right ventricle pressure of 65 mm Hg, and 2 small hemodynamically insignificant ventricular septal defects."
