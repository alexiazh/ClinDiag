        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with non-length-dependent sensory loss primarily affecting her arms more than her legs, with asymmetric reflexes and no evidence of lower motor neuron involvement. Electrodiagnostic studies indicated significant sensory neuron involvement and no acquired demyelination. Neuroimaging suggested posterior column involvement. The combination of clinical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging findings was consistent with a dorsal-root ganglionopathy. Serologic findings of elevated ESR, positive ANA, and rheumatoid factor pointed towards a connective tissue disorder, leading to a diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome."
