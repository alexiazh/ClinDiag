    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Cardiac myxomas arising from the left atrium and the mitral-valve apparatus, consistent with Carney complex.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Thrombi, vegetations, neoplastic processes (including secondary cardiac tumors), primary cardiac neoplasms (specifically myxomas).",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of Cushing's syndrome, presence of two intracardiac masses shown on echocardiogram, and symptoms of syncope and transient ischemic attacks led to the diagnosis. The masses were likely myxomas, specifically associated with Carney complex, as indicated by their characteristics and the patient's clinical history."
