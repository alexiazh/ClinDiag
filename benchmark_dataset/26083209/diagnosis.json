        "final_diagnosis": "Perforation of the right ventricular wall by an implantable cardioverterâ€“defibrillator lead.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Myocardial infarction, acute aortic syndrome, pleuritis, pericarditis, pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, complications of ICD implantation.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, hypotension, ST-segment elevations on ECG, and evidence of pleural and pericardial effusions. Given the recent ICD implantation, the most likely diagnosis was lead migration resulting in myocardial perforation, which explained the constellation of signs and symptoms."
