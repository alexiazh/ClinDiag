        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of periventricular nodular heterotopia was supported by MRI findings showing heterotopic nodules of gray matter in the bilateral temporal and occipital lobes, as well as genetic testing revealing a heterozygous missense mutation in the RELN gene. The patient presented with seizure types strongly suggestive of focal seizures, with EEG and SEEG findings that indicated heterotopic gray matter as the source of seizure activity."
