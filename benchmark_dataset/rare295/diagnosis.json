        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant presented with elevated levels of C14 and related metabolites on the newborn screen, and exome sequencing revealed biallelic variants in ACADVL associated with the condition. Additionally, the infant's clinical decline and subsequent cardiac arrest following feeding suggested metabolic decompensation typical of a fatty acid oxidation disorder."
