        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed histologically in 4 family members showing typical bluish-to-livid tumors with hyperchromatic cuboid nuclei and expanded vascular cavities. Immunohistochemical staining indicated a vascular smooth muscle origin, and genetic linkage analysis excluded linkage to chromosome 11q23, supporting the diagnosis of familial cutaneous glomangiomas."
