        "final_diagnosis": "Infiltrative cardiomyopathy due to hydroxychloroquine; Long-QT syndrome possibly secondary to hydroxychloroquine; Cardiac-conduction disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Inflammatory cardiomyopathy; Amyloidosis; Fabryâ€™s disease; Hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and symptoms indicative of heart failure. Key findings included ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography not attributable to hypertension or valvular disease, and characteristics suggesting hydroxychloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy, such as myocyte vacuolization seen in endomyocardial biopsy."
