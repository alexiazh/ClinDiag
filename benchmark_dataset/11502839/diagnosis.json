        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism was supported by serum TSH concentrations of 150 mU/liter or more, decreased T4 levels, and absence of thyroid autoantibodies. Scintigraphies did not reveal thyroid tissue, while ultrasonography showed hypoplastic, normally located glands. A heterozygous mutation (Q40P) in the PAX8 gene was identified in the patient, demonstrating impaired binding and transactivation related to thyroid development. The familial analysis suggested variable expressivity given the mother's normal thyroid size and mild adult-onset hypothyroidism associated with the same mutation."
