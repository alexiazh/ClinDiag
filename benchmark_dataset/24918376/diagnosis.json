        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation, including a heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules, aligns with dermatomyositis. The new and widespread eruption of white, depressed papules on the torso and face suggested malignant atrophic papulosis. Biopsy findings supported the diagnosis, revealing ischemic damage, and subsequent evaluations led to confirmation of both dermatomyositis and malignant atrophic papulosis."
