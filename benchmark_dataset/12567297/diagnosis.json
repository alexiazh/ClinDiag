        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on sustained bacteremia in patients with TIPS devices, with no other identifiable infective focus that could explain the bacteremia after exhaustive workup. Multiple blood cultures positive for the same organism and the temporal relationship to TIPS manipulation were considered significant in confirming infection of the TIPS device."
