        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was supported by evidence of high blood glucose levels (19.2 mmol/L and 18.7 mmol/L), high HbA1c (11.9%), and clinical features such as obesity and acanthosis nigricans. Additionally, negative tests for type 1 diabetes autoantibodies and a strong family history further supported this diagnosis."
