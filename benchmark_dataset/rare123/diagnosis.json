        "differential_diagnosis": "Bullous pemphigoid",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of linear lichen planus was made based on the patient's one-year history of red papules and plaques, severe itching, and the timing of lesions appearing after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. The histopathology findings and immunofluorescent results suggested bullous pemphigoid, but the clinical presentation and the patient's history of oral lichen planus ultimately guided the final diagnosis towards linear lichen planus."
