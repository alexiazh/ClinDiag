        "final_diagnosis": "Medically intractable partial epilepsy likely of left mesial frontal origin",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. H has a history of medically refractory partial seizures characterized as simple partial and secondarily generalized seizures. A combination of diagnostic studies, including EEG showing slow wave activity suggestive of cortical injury, magnetoencephalogram capturing seizures, and invasive EEG telemetry, identified seizure onset localized to the more posterior aspects of the supplementary motor cortex region on the left. The findings indicated a nonlesional epilepsy where surgical outcomes are predicted to be less favorable."
