        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) was based on abnormal newborn thyroid screening test results showing low T4 levels (4.5 µg/dl) and elevated TSH levels (632 mU/liter) in an 8-day-old neonate. Confirmatory tests at 8 days of age reaffirmed the diagnosis with a free T4 of 0.42 ng/dl (normal range 0.9–2.3 ng/dl) and a TSH of 548 mU/liter."
