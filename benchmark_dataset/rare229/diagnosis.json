        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Key clinical features included prominent brow ridges, macroglossia, thickened nose, and elevated growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. The paradoxical increase in GH after TRH stimulation and confirmation of a pituitary tumor further supported the diagnosis of acromegaly."
