        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) was confirmed through next-generation sequencing identifying a homozygous variant, c.617T>C, p.V206A, in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene, which is known to cause FCS. The clinical presentation included severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis, which align with the established characteristics of FCS. The altered fatty acid metabolism, evidenced by high triglyceride levels and the absence of functional LPL, supported the diagnosis."
