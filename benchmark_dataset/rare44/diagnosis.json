        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Aromatase deficiency was supported by clinical findings of progressive increase in stature, genu valgum, and azoospermia. Genetic testing revealed two variants in the CYP19A1 gene, including a likely pathogenic deletion leading to a non-functional aromatase protein and a variant of uncertain significance. The clinical and genetic evidence pointed towards a diagnosis of Aromatase deficiency."
