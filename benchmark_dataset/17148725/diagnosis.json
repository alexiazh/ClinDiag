        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. Q's bone mineral density (BMD) measurements indicated a T score of -1.9 at the femoral neck, which places her in the osteopenic range. Her previous tests had shown osteopenia as well, and her overall risk of fractures was evaluated considering her age, weight, and lifestyle factors. She experienced a notable decline in BMD after discontinuing estrogen therapy, which is also a contributing factor to her diagnosis."
