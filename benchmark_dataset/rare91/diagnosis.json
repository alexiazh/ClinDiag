        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of ADULT syndrome was supported by clinical findings such as progressively declining vision, limb malformations, and dermatologic anomalies in the proband. Molecular testing revealed pathogenic variants in the TP63 and CNGB3 genes, further substantiating the diagnosis through genetic evidence and the presentation of the patient's symptoms."
