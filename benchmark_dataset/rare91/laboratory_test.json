Cycloplegic objective refraction was +6.25/-2×180° in the right eye and +6.75/-2×10 in the left eye, with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 in both eyes. Schirmer test with anesthetics was normal. Mean fluorescein tear-film break-up time was 4 seconds in the right eye and 5 seconds in the left eye, indicating rapid tear evaporation. Anterior segment examination showed bilateral superficial punctuate keratitis. Fundoscopy was unremarkable in both eyes.",
