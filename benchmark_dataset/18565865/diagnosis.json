        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Merkel-cell carcinoma was supported by pathological examination revealing small-cell carcinoma consistent with Merkel-cell characteristics, including a positive immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 20. Imaging studies showed regional lymph node involvement, confirming the diagnosis of stage III disease. The patient's immunosuppressed status due to HIV infection was also noted as a contributing factor."
