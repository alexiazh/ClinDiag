        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was supported by high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies, presence of proteinuria and red-cell casts indicating glomerular injury, and clinical features including arthralgias and signs consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. The echocardiographic findings of a mass involving the mitral valve and the patient's renal biopsy showing lupus nephritis corroborated the diagnosis. The absence of infection as indicated by sterile blood cultures and lack of sustained fever further strengthened the diagnosis against other causes."
