    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Prader-Willi syndrome due to paternal 15q11q13 deletion",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's characteristic clinical presentation, including global developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and distinct facial features. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a mosaic karyotype, and further testing including whole exome sequencing and methylation analysis confirmed the deletion in the 15q11-q13 region, consistent with Prader-Willi syndrome."
