        "final_diagnosis": "Acute Myocardial Ischemia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute myocardial ischemia was made based on the patient's sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain, marked ST depression in the inferolateral ECG leads, and ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias immediately following the intravenous administration of ondansetron. These symptoms resolved quickly after administration of nitroglycerin, and further cardiac evaluations including stress testing and echocardiography showed no evidence of ischemia or myocardial necrosis."
