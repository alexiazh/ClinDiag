        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation, imaging studies showing bilateral ovarian masses and extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, in conjunction with markedly elevated CA-125 levels, suggested an infectious process rather than cancer. The presence of acute inflammation and abscess formation indicated that the most plausible diagnosis was a ruptured endometrioma with superimposed infection."
