        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had an 18-month history of progressive debilitation with upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, supported by clinical examination and electromyographic findings consistent with ALS. Features included fasciculations, atrophy of intrinsic muscles, Babinski signs, and a lack of sensory abnormalities. The rapid onset of symptoms, coupled with the patient's age and cognitive function, further supported the diagnosis of ALS."
