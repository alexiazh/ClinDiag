        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of persistent, slowly worsening dystonic movements, particularly the pronounced diurnal variation and the dramatic therapeutic response to levodopa, strongly suggest Dopa-responsive dystonia. The exclusion of other conditions through clinical examination, imaging, and biochemical tests, alongside the identification of a mutation in the GCH1 gene, further confirm this diagnosis."
