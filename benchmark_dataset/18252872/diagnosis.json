        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. E has reported memory loss and symptoms consistent with neuropathy, including weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles. Neurological evaluations suggested a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy, distinct from alcohol-related conditions, although alcohol use has been significant and might complicate his cognitive and neuropathic conditions. Given the timeline of his symptoms and heavy drinking, the working diagnosis of MCI or early Alzheimer's disease was considered, with the role of alcohol as a contributing factor remaining uncertain."
