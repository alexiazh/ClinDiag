        "differential_diagnosis": "Medication-related confusion, infectious colitis, Clostridium difficile colitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's confusion was likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, related to swallowing blood during recurrent epistaxis, which triggered acute encephalopathy. Improvement followed treatment with lactulose and rifaximin. Additionally, the patient met multiple criteria for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), including a family history of epistaxis and presence of telangiectasias."
