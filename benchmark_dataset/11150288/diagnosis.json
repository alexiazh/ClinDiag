        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients exhibited persistent anterior scleritis that did not respond to standard treatment, raised suspicion of concealed noncompliance with prescribed therapies, and showed signs of self-inflicted injuries such as conjunctival and corneal abrasions. Key indicators for diagnosis included lack of improvement despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, the presence of traumatic ocular surface irritation, and behavioral signs indicating possible malingering."
