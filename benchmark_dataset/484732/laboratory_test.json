            "findings": "Baseline predexamethasone cortisol values were abnormally high; postdexamethasone cortisol levels remained elevated. After 4 ECTs, postdexamethasone cortisol values showed suppression throughout the day. After 7 ECTs, predexamethasone cortisol values were normal with normal diurnal variation; postdexamethasone levels were elevated but decreased steadily throughout the day. After 9 ECTs, all postdexamethasone cortisol levels were normally suppressed.",
            "changes_over_time": "Predexamethasone cortisol values were elevated after the first ECT and showed a reverse in the expected diurnal variation. After 4 ECTs, a definite clinical improvement was observed. After 7 ECTs, predexamethasone cortisol values normalized, and after 9 ECTs, all postdexamethasone levels showed normal suppression. The improvement in postdexamethasone cortisol suppression was highly correlated with behavioral ratings of depression."
