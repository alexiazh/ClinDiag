        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) was based on the presence of multiple sebaceous tumors, a significant family history of colon cancer, and the detection of a systemic mutation in the MSH2 gene, despite the absence of visceral malignancy. Immunosuppression due to kidney transplantation was considered to have unmasked the MTS phenotype."
