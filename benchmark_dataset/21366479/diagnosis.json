        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of insulinoma was supported by the occurrence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose level of 40 mg/dL) that correlated with the patient's episodic neurologic symptoms, which resolved upon glucose administration, satisfying Whippleâ€™s triad. Additional tests confirmed inappropriate endogenous insulin production as evidenced by elevated insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemic episodes, ruling out exogenous insulin administration."
