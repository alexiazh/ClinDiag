        "final_diagnosis": "Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (C-APLAS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Myocarditis, giant-cell myocarditis, necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis, lupus myocarditis, thrombotic events, microvascular thrombosis.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute severe myocardial dysfunction and clinical features suggesting myocyte necrosis. Initial assessments ruled out acute coronary syndrome due to normal epicardial coronary arteries. Elevated troponin I levels, echocardiographic findings of severe biventricular dysfunction, and a myocardial biopsy confirming ischemic microvascular injury led to the diagnosis of C-APLAS."
