            "relevant_findings": "Cycloplegic refraction revealed bilateral high myopia and astigmatism (RE: -9.75DS/-3.50DC*177°, LE: -12.50DS/-3.50DC*12°). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was LogMAR 0.4 (Snellen 20/50) in the right eye and LogMAR 0.54 (Snellen 20/70) in the left eye. Anterior segment was unremarkable. Vitreous liquification and tessellated fundus were noted. The optic disc was surrounded by a ring of chorioretinal atrophy. Multiple thin emanating vessels and posterior staphyloma centered with the optic disc were observed. Grade 3 macular hypoplasia was noted with the absence of foveal pit, extrusion of the inner retina layer, and lengthening of the outer segment. Choroidal atrophy and staphyloma were present in both eyes. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was 40 µm in the right eye and 38 µm in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) showed increased vessel density with reduction of the foveal avascular zone. Axial lengths were 28.88 mm (OD) and 29.59 mm (OS).",
            "changes_over_time": "The patient has experienced progressive deterioration of vision bilaterally over the past 2 years, with poor vision since early childhood."
