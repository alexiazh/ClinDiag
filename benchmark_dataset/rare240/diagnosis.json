    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "48,XXYY syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, which included progressive bilateral vision deterioration, craniofacial dysmorphology (ocular hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, epicanthic folds), and motor development delays. Objective findings such as high myopia and astigmatism, as well as specific retinal findings (grade 3 macular hypoplasia, choroidal atrophy, and structural anomalies in the optic disc), contributed to the diagnosis. Genetic analysis through Whole Exome Sequencing also supported the diagnosis of 48,XXYY syndrome."
