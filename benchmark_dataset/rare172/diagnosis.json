        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a palmar tumor characterized by redness and pain, confirmed by MRI and histological analysis showing an increase in spindle-shaped cells that did not stain for CD34/CD31, leading to the diagnosis of spindle cell hemangioma. The absence of recurrence and mobility restrictions after surgical intervention further supported the diagnosis."
