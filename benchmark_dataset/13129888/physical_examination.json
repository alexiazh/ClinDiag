            "relevant_findings": "External examination revealed full cheeks and jaw, marked mongoloid palpebral slant, inferior scleral show, and upward deviation of the eyes. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25-2 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Decreased contrast sensitivity in the right eye. No abnormalities noted in the optic discs, but there was wrinkling of the internal limiting membranes in each fundus. Automated perimetry demonstrated bilateral superonasal defects. Right hypertropia with an 'A' pattern esotropia, bilateral superior oblique overaction, bilateral inferior oblique underaction, and an incyclotorsion greater than 35Â° in primary gaze.",
            "changes_over_time": "Best-corrected visual acuity decreased from 20/15 in both eyes 4 years earlier to 20/25-2 in the right eye. Eighteen months postoperatively, optic nerve dysfunction, proptosis, and diplopia in upgaze remained. Seven years after the initial surgery, recurrence in the left orbital floor was noted, causing a sudden decrease in vision due to compressive optic neuropathy."
