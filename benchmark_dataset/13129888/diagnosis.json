        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of bilateral GCRG in the patient with cherubism is strongly supported by the histopathologic features of the orbital lesions, which included scattered giant cells in a fibroblastic stroma with small vascular channels. Additionally, the clinical manifestations, age of onset, rate of growth of the lesions, and severity of the orbital symptoms were considered in arriving at the final diagnosis."
