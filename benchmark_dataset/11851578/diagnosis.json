        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was recognized because blood cultures were obtained prior to the administration of antibiotics. Key evidence included the isolation of Bacillus anthracis from blood cultures and the presence of viable B anthracis in postmortem mediastinal lymph node specimens despite rapid sterilization of the bloodstream after antibiotic initiation."
