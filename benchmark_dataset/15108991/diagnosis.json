        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia was confirmed through elevated resting creatine kinase levels, rapid exhaustion after exercise, and positive results from the in vitro halothane/caffeine muscle test. Genetic screening revealed RYR1 mutations (Arg2435His and Ile2453Thr) consistent with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility."
