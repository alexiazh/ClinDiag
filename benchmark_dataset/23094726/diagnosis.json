        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited recurrent hypoglycemic episodes with symptoms of confusion and altered mental status. MRI findings indicated a well-defined lesion in the pancreatic body, consistent with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and laboratory results showed high insulin levels in conjunction with hypoglycemia. These findings, alongside the absence of ketones, suggested a hyperinsulinemic state rather than factitious hypoglycemia or other disorders."
