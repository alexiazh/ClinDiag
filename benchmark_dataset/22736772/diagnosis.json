        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Five PHP1B patients developed concomitantly elevated serum calcium and PTH levels consistent with tertiary hyperparathyroidism after many years of secondary hyperparathyroidism owing to renal PTH resistance. Key findings included elevated calcium and PTH levels, symptoms of hypocalcemia, and the presence of enlarged parathyroid glands in imaging studies."
