        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited parkinsonian signs, including tremors and bradykinesia, alongside significant depressive symptoms. Positive response to ECT suggested an overlap in the biochemical conditions related to both Parkinson's disease and depression. Improvements in extrapyramidal symptoms were noted before improvements in depressive symptoms, indicating a specific antiparkinsonian effect of ECT."
