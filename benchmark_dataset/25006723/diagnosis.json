        "final_diagnosis": "Cerebral vasculitis due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Infection, Multiple cranial neuropathies, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Meningovascular syphilis, Acanthamoeba encephalitis, Listeria monocytogenes infection, Cerebral emboli",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation and MRI findings suggested a multifocal, ischemic process consistent with cerebral vasculitis, likely due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Despite a decreased ANCA level, comprehensive testing did not reveal alternative infectious causes, and the progression of neurological symptoms alongside MRI evidence supported the diagnosis."
