        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The reasoning for the final diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was supported by the presence of a noncaseating granuloma identified in the biopsy of the leptomeninges and pituitary stalk. MRI findings indicated an enhancing infundibular process involving the optic chiasm, pituitary, and hypothalamus, combined with clinical symptoms such as visual loss and increased thirst, which signaled potential hypothalamic involvement."
