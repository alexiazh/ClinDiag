        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Prenatal diagnosis of X-LAG was established through chromosome Xq26.3 microduplication identified via single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray. Postnatally, the infant exhibited clinical features of rapid growth, accompanied by elevated concentrations of prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), along with an enlarging suprasellar pituitary mass, confirming the diagnosis."
