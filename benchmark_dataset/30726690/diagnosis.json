        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with weight loss, night sweats, and nausea, raising concern for a malignant disorder, particularly in an elderly individual. Initial investigations focused on cancer and glomerulonephritis-related conditions. The negative results for infective endocarditis and other malignancies, combined with recurrent salmonella infections and the presence of systemic symptoms, suggested the underlying immune deficiency of AIDS, which was confirmed by a positive HIV test and low CD4 count."
