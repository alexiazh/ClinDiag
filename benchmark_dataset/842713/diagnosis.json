        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of anorexia nervosa, but after a thorough evaluation that included normal brain tumor studies, a hypothalamic glioma was discovered later on. The initial diagnosis was supported by the patient's weight loss and depressive mood, but the underlying tumor was identified as contributing to the anorexic symptoms."
