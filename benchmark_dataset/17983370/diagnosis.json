    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hyper-IgD syndrome, cyclic neutropenia, familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, CIAS1-related autoinflammatory syndromes",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PFAPA was supported by the patient's typical periodic fever pattern, elevated acute phase reactants during episodes with normalization between episodes, normal IgD level, and the presence of pharyngitis during fevers. The dramatic response to prednisone further strengthens the diagnosis, as other periodic fever syndromes do not exhibit such a response."
