        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain associated with a history of injection drug use. Examination revealed signs of possible endocarditis, including a murmur and tachycardia. Imaging indicated cavitary pulmonary nodules consistent with septic emboli. Blood cultures confirmed the presence of S. aureus, supporting a diagnosis of endocarditis. The patient's substance use disorder is seen as an underlying cause for these complications."
