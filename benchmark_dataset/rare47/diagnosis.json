        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a rapidly enlarging mass in the right breast, imaging studies showing a large soft tissue density mass with clear borders, and a biopsy confirming a fibroepithelial tumor. Postoperative immunohistochemistry also provided relevant tumor characterization."
