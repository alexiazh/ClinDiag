        "final_diagnosis": "CARD9 deficiency with relapsing Candida albicans meningoencephalitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CARD9 deficiency was supported by the identification of a novel homozygous mutation in CARD9, in conjunction with clinical findings of recurrent meningoencephalitis due to C. albicans. Despite antifungal treatment, the patient continued to experience relapses, demonstrating impaired GM-CSF responses that likely contributed to the pathogenesis of spontaneous CNS candidiasis. Adjunctive GM-CSF therapy resulted in sustained clinical remission."
