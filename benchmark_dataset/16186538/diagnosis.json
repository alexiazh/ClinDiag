        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of impaired energy metabolism, abnormal muscle histology, and two mutations in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene, alongside elevated methylmalonate levels in urine and plasma, supported the diagnosis of mut-methylmalonic aciduria. The exercise test indicated reduced maximal workload and oxygen uptake, and muscle biopsy showed subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction."
