        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Diagnosis of idiopathic LSCD was established after excluding known etiologies of LSCD. Key evidence included bilateral conjunctivalization, late fluorescein staining indicating poor barrier function, and impression cytology revealing conjunctival goblet cells on the corneal surface. The diagnosis was supported by demographic data showing a female predominance and a familial tendency."
