        "final_diagnosis": "Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "RPD were identified as subretinal deposits located within the outer nuclear layer, affecting photoreceptor integrity and associated with retinal gliosis and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage. The presence of vitronectin-rich extracellular deposits, the altered cellular structure in regions with RPD, and the significant thinning of the outer nuclear layer in areas overlying RPD supported the diagnosis."
