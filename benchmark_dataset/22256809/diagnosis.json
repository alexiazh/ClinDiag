        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had progressive dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates; CT scans showed a mass in the chest wall associated with the breast implant. The presence of a soft-tissue mass and pulmonary nodules raised suspicion of angiosarcoma, especially considering the patient's history of breast implant-related pain and immunosuppression. Additionally, bronchoalveolar lavage indicated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, supported by positive cultures and fungal antigen tests."
