        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of AME was confirmed based on the clinical presentation of severe hypertension, biochemical findings of hypokalemia, low renin, undetectable aldosterone, and an abnormally high urinary THFs to THE ratio, consistent with HSD11B2 enzyme deficiency. A novel homozygous mutation in the HSD11B2 gene resulting in an Ala221Gly substitution further supported the diagnosis."
