        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of recurrent lentigo maligna (LM) on her left cheek that evolved into a partially amelanotic LMM after several excisions. Key indicators for diagnosis included the gradual enlargement of the lesion, development of hypopigmentation, and biopsies suggesting progression to invasive melanoma."
