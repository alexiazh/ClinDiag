        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The CT findings of relapsing and remitting diffuse, circumferential, edematous thickening of the gastric antrum and duodenum, along with the patient's history of similar episodes and the family history of hereditary angioedema, supported the diagnosis. Additionally, the exclusion of neoplastic processes and the unremarkable laboratory values further corroborated the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema."
