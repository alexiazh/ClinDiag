        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnostic procedure revealed diffuse nodularity and heterogeneous architecture in the liver consistent with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. Iron deposits were detected in the liver, heart, and pancreas, which are typical findings in neonatal hemochromatosis. Biochemical tests ruled out other causes of hepatic failure and thus, neonate hemochromatosis was considered the most likely diagnosis."
