        "differential_diagnosis": "Sterile pulmonary infarction due to thromboembolism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by histopathologic examination of material from a wedge resection revealing invasive filamentous fungal infection consistent with Aspergillus species. The patient had no evidence of underlying immunodeficiency, with normal leukocyte counts and normal responses to various antigens. The inhaled fluticasone therapy was proposed as a contributing factor to the development of the fungal infection."
