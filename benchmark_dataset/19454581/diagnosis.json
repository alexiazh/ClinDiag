        "final_diagnosis": "Severe congenital hyperthyroidism due to a constitutive activating mutation of the TSH receptor (TSH-R)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed by the high levels of free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3) with undetectable TSH levels. Additional findings included persistent undetectable or low serum TSH concentrations even when serum FT4 and FT3 levels were mostly normal, indicating an abnormality in the feedback mechanism regulating TSH secretion."
