        "final_diagnosis": "HBV-associated polyarteritis nodosa",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Diabetic neuropathy, vasculitides (systemic and nonsystemic), sarcoidosis, infectious processes (e.g., leprosy, Lyme disease, syphilis, cytomegalovirus infection, HIV infection), amyloidosis, and neoplastic infiltration.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited fevers, progressive weakness, and asymmetric motor and sensory neuropathies, which led to the suspicion of a vasculitic process. Laboratory findings indicated ongoing HBV viremia, while nerve and muscle biopsies revealed active vasculitis with ischemic damage. The clinical presentation and test results, including elevated gamma globulin levels and ANCA positivity, indicated HBV-associated polyarteritis nodosa."
