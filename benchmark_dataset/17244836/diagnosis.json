        "differential_diagnosis": "Atherosclerotic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Systemic Vasculitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of inflammatory AAA was supported by imaging studies revealing a fusiform dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta with extensive soft tissue inflammation surrounding the aorta. Unlike typical atherosclerotic AAA, the patient presented with recurrent flank pain, and laboratory findings such as elevated ESR were observed in prior evaluations. Inflammatory AAA was distinguished from systemic vasculitis, which was initially considered but ruled out based on the patient's age and absence of systemic symptoms associated with vasculitis."
