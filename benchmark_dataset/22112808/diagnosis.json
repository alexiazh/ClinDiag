        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by extremely elevated intestinal calcium absorption (approximately 90% from ingested calcium) and the identification of a rare homozygous deletion in the CYP24A1 gene, leading to undetectable levels of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In vivo functional studies confirmed decreased 24-hydroxylase activity, further demonstrating the causal role of CYP24A1 in this case of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia."
