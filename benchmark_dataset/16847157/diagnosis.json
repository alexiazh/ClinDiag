        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, clinical symptoms including exertional dyspnea and general fatigue, and findings from GI endoscopy showing multiple telangiectases. Imaging studies, including a chest radiograph and computed tomography, revealed a lobulated mass in the lung with a large feeding artery and draining veins, confirmed by pulmonary angiography which demonstrated a large PAVF."
