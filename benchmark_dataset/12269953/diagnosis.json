        "final_diagnosis": "Carcinoid tumor causing occupational asthma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Occupational asthma, asthma due to flour exposure, bronchial hyperreactivity",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a significant history of respiratory symptoms aggravated by flour exposure. While he exhibited IgE sensitization to wheat and barley flour, specific inhalation challenge did not induce bronchial hyperreactivity. This, combined with the discovery of a tumor in the left bronchi via bronchoscopy, led to the diagnosis of carcinoid tumor instead of occupational asthma."
