        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation with an elevated white blood cell count and acute abdominal symptoms, along with imaging findings of a solid adnexal mass separate from the uterus and the presence of ascites and pleural effusion, suggest a benign ovarian tumor such as a fibroma. The imaging characteristics (low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MR images, absence of fat) and the history of pain indicative of possible torsion supported the diagnosis of Meigs syndrome."
