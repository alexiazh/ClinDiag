    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "ST-segmentâ€“elevation myocardial infarction due to proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The ECG showed typical findings of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, specifically indicating a proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery before the first diagonal and first septal branches. The angiography confirmed these findings, and careful analysis of ST-segment behavior indicated the location and extent of myocardial involvement."
