        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's severe hypotension and bradycardia, alongside symptoms of anorexia, weakness, and mental status changes, suggested both adrenal insufficiency and severe hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests indicated primary hypothyroidism, and the patient's history of prolonged glucocorticoid usage raised concerns for adrenal insufficiency."
