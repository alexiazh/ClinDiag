        "differential_diagnosis": "Systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and pulmonary hypertension due to connective-tissue disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient showed signs of severe pulmonary hypertension alongside symptoms suggestive of a rheumatologic condition, including Raynaud's phenomenon and joint pain. A positive test for antiâ€“U1-RNP antibody supports the diagnosis of mixed connective-tissue disease, while other potential diagnoses such as lupus and scleroderma were ruled out based on specific antibody testing and the absence of typical manifestations."
