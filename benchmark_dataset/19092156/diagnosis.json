    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Splenic marginal-zone lymphoma, with anemia due to Coombs’-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia and splenic sequestration, and prolonged partial-thromboplastin time due to a lupus anticoagulant.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy-cell leukemia, Gaucher’s disease, myeloproliferative diseases, including chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, T-cell lymphomas, and viral or bacterial infections.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of splenic marginal-zone lymphoma was supported by clinical features of massive splenomegaly, minimal lymphadenopathy, isolated anemia, and mild IgM paraproteinemia. The combination of hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, and findings from the bone marrow biopsy indicating a B-cell population consistent with this diagnosis were key to the diagnostic conclusion."
