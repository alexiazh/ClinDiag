        "final_diagnosis": "Eosinophilic fasciitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of asthenia, inflammatory muscle and joint pain, subcutaneous nodules, and symmetrical edema of the lower limbs. Further, the biopsy of the subcutaneous nodule revealed panniculitis with septal inflammation, primarily composed of lymphocytes, indicative of an underlying inflammatory process consistent with eosinophilic fasciitis. The imaging studies also indicated hypermetabolism in soft tissues, which contributed to the diagnosis."
