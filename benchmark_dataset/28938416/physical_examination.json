C-peptide levels were below the lower limit of detection. The pancreas weight was decreased with an RPW of 0.49. Histological analysis showed a marked loss of b cells, extremely low insulin area (0%) and mass (1.5 mg) with no evidence of b-cell proliferation. Moderate acinar atrophy and acinar and periductular fibrosis were also observed.",
