    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) associated with variants in MYH7 and CD36 genes",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by prenatal echocardiography revealing LVNC, double outlet of the right ventricle, interruption of the aorta, and aortic stenosis. Genetic testing identified a novel heterozygous splicing variant in MYH7 and a heterozygous missense variant in CD36, both considered likely pathogenic."
