    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Tricuspid valve mass with right-to-left shunt (platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pulmonary embolism, tricuspid valve vegetation, myocardial ischemia, cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy, anemia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of marked hypoxemia and positional desaturation led to the discovery of a right-to-left shunt across a patent foramen ovale. The presence of a large mass on the tricuspid valve, discovered via echocardiogram, and the patientâ€™s history of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and central venous catheter use supported the diagnosis."
