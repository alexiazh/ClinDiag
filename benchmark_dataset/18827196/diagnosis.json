        "differential_diagnosis": "Intermittent Claudication, Myocardial Ischemia, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. S presented with long-standing poorly controlled hypertension and was found to have severe stenosis at the origin of the main left renal artery. Her fatigue symptoms were out of proportion to expected deconditioning, suggesting other underlying issues. The diagnosis of unilateral RAS was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography, and with optimized antihypertensive treatment, her blood pressure improved, thus the decision was made not to intervene surgically at present."
