        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Knobloch syndrome was supported by the presence of an occipital meningocele discovered antenatally, severe myopia since infancy, and normal developmental and cognitive assessments. Additional findings on MRI scans, which showed cystic lesions and ventriculomegaly, contributed to the overall clinical picture."
