        "final_diagnosis": "hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis (HFTC2)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of HFTC2 was made based on the identification of a novel homozygous missense mutation (S129P) in FGF23. This mutation was shown to impair O-glycosylation and resulted in severely reduced secretion of the mutant FGF23, explaining the hyperphosphatemic phenotype. The clinical findings of hyperphosphatemia, normal serum calcium, and the patient's family history supported this diagnosis."
