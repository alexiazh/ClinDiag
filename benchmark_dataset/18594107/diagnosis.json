        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's history of painless common peroneal nerve palsy immediately postoperatively, neurophysiological studies confirming a complete lesion, and a positive Tinel sign. Surgical exploration revealed complete transection of the nerve with a neuroma, corroborated by the absence of conduction across the lesion."
