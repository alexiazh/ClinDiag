        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fatigue, hoarseness, periorbital edema, and abnormal laboratory findings including elevated creatine kinase and AST levels. The clinical features suggested a global disease process. Elevation of thyrotropin levels indicated lack of adherence to thyroid hormone replacement therapy, supporting the diagnosis of severe hypothyroidism. Symptoms such as hoarseness and periorbital edema are consistent with hypothyroidism, and potential medication mismanagement was likely a factor."
