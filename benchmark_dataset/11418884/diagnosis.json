        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of hepatopulmonary nocardiosis was established through imaging studies and positive cultures from lung and liver aspirates revealing gram-positive, modified acid-fast bacillus-positive filaments consistent with Nocardia species. The patient's clinical presentation included fever, cough, and abdominal pain, alongside imaging findings of consolidation and abscesses, all supporting the diagnosis."
