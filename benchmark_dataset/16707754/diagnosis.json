        "final_diagnosis": "Budd–Chiari syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Myeloproliferative disorders, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, cardiac causes",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with ascites, abdominal pain, and deep venous thrombosis, along with laboratory findings such as a high serum–ascites albumin gradient indicating portal hypertension. Imaging showed hepatic venous outflow obstruction, with absent hepatic veins and narrowing of the inferior vena cava. The presence of the factor V Leiden mutation and the V617F mutation in JAK2 provided additional evidence supporting the hypercoagulable state contributing to Budd–Chiari syndrome."
