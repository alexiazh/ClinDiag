    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Methyl bromide intoxication",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Energy deprivation syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's occupational exposure to methyl bromide, along with the symmetric brainstem and cerebellar lesions observed on MRI, supports the diagnosis of methyl bromide intoxication. The clinical presentation of ataxia, paresthesias, and resolution of symptoms upon cessation of exposure also align with this diagnosis. Additionally, elevated pyruvate levels reinforce the notion that this condition represents an energy deprivation syndrome resulting from the toxic effects of methyl bromide."
