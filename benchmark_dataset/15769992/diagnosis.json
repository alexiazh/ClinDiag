        "final_diagnosis": "IMAGe association (intrauterine growth retardation, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, genital anomalies)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita, genomic imprinting disorders, autosomal recessive conditions",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of IMAGe association was supported by the presence of characteristic clinical features in affected individuals such as severe intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), adrenal insufficiency with laboratory findings, and genital anomalies. Genetic studies showed no mutations in the DAX1 gene, which is usually associated with X-linked adrenal hypoplasia, indicating a potential new genetic mutation or an imprinting mechanism. The inheritance pattern was noted to be maternal, contradicting classical Mendelian inheritance patterns."
