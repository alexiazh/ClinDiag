        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on Ms. A's significant anxiety and her history of recurrent asthma attacks, which were exacerbated by her anxiety. A psychiatric interview revealed her anxious state and the impact of significant life traumas on her health condition. Furthermore, the improvement in her breathing pattern and anxiety levels following biofeedback treatment supported the diagnosis."
