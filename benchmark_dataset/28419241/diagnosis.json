        "final_diagnosis": "Central congenital hypothyroidism due to TRHR mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A homozygous missense mutation in TRHR was identified, causing impaired ligand affinity and transactivation. The patient exhibited moderate hypothyroidism with abnormal thyroid function tests and hyperthyrotropinemia, indicating central hypothyroidism. The mutation was shown to disrupt TRHR-Gq coupling and signaling, leading to low TSH biopotency."
