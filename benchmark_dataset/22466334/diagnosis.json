        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Identification of mutations in PROKR2 associated with PSIS, including heterozygous mutations p.Leu173Arg and p.Arg85His, which were found to impair receptor signaling activity and are previously documented in isolated hypogonadotroph hypogonadism. MRI findings of ectopic posterior pituitary lobe and absent pituitary stalk further supported the diagnosis."
