        "final_diagnosis": "primary Epstein-Barr virus infection with pneumonia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's fever and dry cough occurring three weeks after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, with serological tests showing that both the recipient and the donor were initially EBV seronegative. A high EBV load was detected in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, confirming the presence of EBV pneumonia. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings indicated that the lung involvement was due to primary EBV infection, likely transmitted from the donor."
