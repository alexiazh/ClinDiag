        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hereditary methemoglobinemia was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of dyspnea and cyanosis, combined with the significantly elevated methemoglobin level of 36.9%. The rapid response to methylene blue treatment, which normalized the methemoglobin level to 2.0% and improved oxygen saturation to 99%, further confirmed the diagnosis. Genetic testing revealed a rare homozygous variant in the CYB5R3 gene associated with methemoglobinemia."
