    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Left hippocampal sclerosis with anterior temporal cortical dysplasia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by findings from video-EEG telemetry revealing interictal sharp/slow wave discharges over the left anterior quadrant and an ictal SPECT study showing increased uptake in the entire left temporal lobe. MRI demonstrated left hippocampal sclerosis and cortical dysplasia, consistent with the seizure focus."
