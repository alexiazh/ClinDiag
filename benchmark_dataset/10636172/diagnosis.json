        "final_diagnosis": "Mitochondrial myopathy with A3243G mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and pseudo-obstruction) were noted as initial manifestations. Genetic testing revealed the A3243G mutation with a higher proportion of mutated mtDNA in the rectal biopsy (70%) compared to blood (53%), indicating critical levels for abnormal function. Neuroimaging exhibited bilateral calcification of lenticular nuclei and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The findings of abnormal mitochondria in a rectal biopsy further supported the diagnosis."
