Follow-up radiograph showed partial reexpansion of the right upper lobe, a poorly defined opacity in the left lung, and no pleural effusion. Final radiograph showed almost complete resolution of the pneumothorax, increased diffuse air-space opacity in both lungs consistent with pulmonary edema, and bilateral pleural effusions."
