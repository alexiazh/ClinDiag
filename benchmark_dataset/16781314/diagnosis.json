        "final_diagnosis": "Ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome (EDSF)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Acrodermatitis enteropathica",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome was supported by the presence of characteristic clinical features including skin fragility, alopecia, and nail dystrophy, alongside histopathological findings showing widening of intercellular spaces and reduced desmosomes. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous mutation (888delC) in the PKP1 gene, confirming the diagnosis. Previous consideration of acrodermatitis enteropathica was ruled out as no pathogenic mutation was identified in the SLC39A4 gene."
