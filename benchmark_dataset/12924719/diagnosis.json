        "final_diagnosis": "Familial cavernous malformation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1; Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with over 100 cavernous malformations throughout the CNS, including intramedullary spinal cord lesions, and prominent café-au-lait skin lesions. Genetic analysis confirmed a novel mutation in the KRIT1/CCM1 gene, which is associated with familial cavernous malformations. The presence of café-au-lait lesions, often seen in conditions like NF1, but without accompanying major findings of NF1, further supported the diagnosis of familial cavernous malformation."
