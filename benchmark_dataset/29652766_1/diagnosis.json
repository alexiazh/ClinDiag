        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CRMO was based on the presence of culture-negative inflammatory bone lesions, clinical and imaging signs consistent with CRMO, and supportive family history of autoimmune conditions. Biopsy results indicated chronic inflammation and the absence of infectious organisms, which were critical in excluding other potential diagnoses. The condition is recognized as a diagnosis of exclusion, further supported by imaging findings and patient response to anti-inflammatory treatment."
