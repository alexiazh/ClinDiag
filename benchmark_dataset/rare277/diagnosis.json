        "final_diagnosis": "Multiple symmetric lipomatosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of multiple symmetric lipomatosis was supported by the observation of slowly growing fat masses in the neck and upper trunk, MRI findings showing widespread soft masses of fat density in the subcutaneous layer, and the patient's clinical history of alcohol consumption. The absence of pressure symptoms from the masses and the decision to decline further diagnostic procedures also guided the management and confirmed the diagnosis."
