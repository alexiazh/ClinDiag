        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's long history of engaging in bingeing, purging, and laxative abuse, along with significant distress and a documented resistance to previous treatment forms, led to the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. She had previously exhibited symptoms of anorexia nervosa but later developed behaviors consistent with bulimia, including high-frequency laxative abuse and binge eating. The complexity of her psychiatric history included recurring depressive episodes and obsessive-compulsive features, yet the current focus was on her eating disorder symptoms which were more pronounced at the time of assessment."
