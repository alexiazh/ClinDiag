        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Bowen-Conradi syndrome is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including failure to thrive, congenital anomalies such as dolichocephaly, low-set ears, and hypotonia, along with cranial CT findings of bilateral cortical hypoplasia. The patient's birth history and significant features at physical examination align with the known characteristics of Bowen-Conradi syndrome."
