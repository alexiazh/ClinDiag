        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the cervix was supported by gynecological examination findings such as vaginal discharge, cervical thickening, and positive blood on palpation. Imaging, including ultrasound and pelvic MRI, indicated cervical cancer with invasion of surrounding structures. A cervical biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, and postoperative pathology showed minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the cervix with invasion and metastasis to lymph nodes."
