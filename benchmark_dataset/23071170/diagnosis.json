        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of EA2 was supported by the patient's episodic gait ataxia lasting hours, possible associated symptoms (nystagmus, dysarthria), and responsiveness to acetazolamide. The family history suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and genetic testing identified a novel nonsense mutation in the CACNA1A gene, which is known to be associated with EA2."
