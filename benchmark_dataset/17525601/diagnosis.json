        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ARDS was supported by the clinical picture, which included bilateral crackles, hypoxemia with an arterial oxygen saturation of 92% on 15 l/min oxygen, and bilateral alveolointerstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph. Positive urinary antigen for legionella pneumophila was also noted, and the clinical criteria for ARDS were met according to the American-European consensus conference."
