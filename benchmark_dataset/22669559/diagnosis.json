        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms R developed postoperative delirium characterized by acute confusion, which persisted following her surgeries, especially after complications like sepsis. The initial episode occurred three days following a colectomy with an anastomotic leak, and the second episode occurred immediately postoperatively after ileostomy closure without complications. Psychiatric evaluation confirmed delirium in both instances. This condition often occurs in older adults undergoing major operations and is associated with poor outcomes."
