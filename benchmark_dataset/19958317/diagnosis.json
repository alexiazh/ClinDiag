        "final_diagnosis": "Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) to cow's milk",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical history, presentation, and histological findings were strongly suggestive of FPIES to cow's milk. Extensive laboratory investigations ruled out infective causes and other metabolic defects. The child's symptoms developed after his first introduction to unhydrolysed cow's milk protein at the age of four, which is atypical for FPIES."
