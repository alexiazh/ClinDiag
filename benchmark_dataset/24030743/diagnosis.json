        "final_diagnosis": "Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the lung",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to lung",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the lung was made based on the presence of typical acinar or papillary adenocarcinoma features along with a component resembling hepatocellular carcinoma, evidenced by immunohistochemical profiling. The study established a distinction from metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma by evaluating morphology and the immunohistochemical panel, which included markers such as CK8, CK18, and others. The absence of liver mass lesions further supported the primary lung diagnosis amidst clinical confusion due to the patients' histories of hepatitis C."
