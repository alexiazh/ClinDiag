        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's progressive weakness, falling, orthostatic hypotension, bruising, gingival bleeding, and rapid improvement following vitamin supplementation were consistent with scurvy. Other vitamin deficiencies were identified, and the patient's history of alcohol use and previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery contributed to the risk of these deficiencies."
