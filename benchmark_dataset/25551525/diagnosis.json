        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital leptin deficiency due to biologically inactive leptin (p.D100Y mutation)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Mutation in leptin receptor (LEPR)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical phenotype of early-onset extreme obesity and hyperphagia led to suspicion of leptin receptor mutation, which was ruled out by sequencing. A novel homozygous mutation (c.298Gâ†’T) in the LEP gene caused high circulating levels of nonfunctional leptin (p.D100Y), which failed to bind to the leptin receptor or induce the expected biological response. Treatment with metreleptin resulted in rapid normalization of eating behavior and significant weight loss."
