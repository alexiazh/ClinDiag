        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis is based on the findings of a newly discovered PHD2 mutation affecting PHD2 function, leading to erythrocytosis and the occurrence of a recurrent abdominal paraganglioma. Loss of heterozygosity of PHD2 in the tumor suggests PHD2 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene."
