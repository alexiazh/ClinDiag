        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Meckel Syndrome was based on genetic testing that included Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) to identify mutations in MKS1 associated with the condition in the couple's aborted fetuses. Additional validation methods included Sanger sequencing and RT-PCR to analyze MKS1 expression, supported by Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation for protein interactions. These comprehensive genetic analyses confirmed the presence of pathogenic mutations consistent with Meckel Syndrome."
