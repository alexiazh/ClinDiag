        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of superficial spreading melanoma excised 11 years prior, development of a mass in the right groin, imaging findings showing hypermetabolic lymph nodes, and pathological examination of a biopsy revealing metastatic melanoma were key factors supporting the diagnosis. The final diagnosis was confirmed by further biopsy and genetic testing showing the BRAF V600E mutation."
