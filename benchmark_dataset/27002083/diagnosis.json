        "final_diagnosis": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe bilateral lower extremity swelling and pain, primarily affecting her thighs. Given her recent air travel and use of combination oral contraceptives, she had risk factors for DVT. Duplex ultrasound confirmed extensive thrombus with lack of venous compressibility, consistent with obstructing DVTs. The absence of pulmonary embolism on CT and specific examination findings further supported the diagnosis of DVT as the primary concern."
