        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia was supported by the presence of telangiectasias in the oral mucosa and hands, a positive family history of nasal hemorrhage, and the detection of heterozygous variants of the ACVRL1 gene which has pathogenic significance. Additional findings such as the patientâ€™s history of epistaxis, mild edema, and imaging studies showing arteriovenous malformations also contributed to this diagnosis."
