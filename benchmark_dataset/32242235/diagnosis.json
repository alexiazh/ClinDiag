        "final_diagnosis": "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) with MCM8 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of POI was supported by significant findings including high levels of FSH (124 UI/l), low estradiol levels, absence of follicles in the ovaries, and physical characteristics such as intra-uterine growth retardation and primary amenorrhea. A novel nonsense mutation in the MCM8 gene was identified, suggesting a genetic basis for the POI and associated syndromic features, including multiple pilomatricomas."
