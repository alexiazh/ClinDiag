        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of insulinoma was established based on the patient's acute hypoglycemic symptoms, confirmed by a serum glucose level of 28 mg/dl and subsequent biochemical indices showing elevated insulin and C-peptide levels during fasting. Imaging revealed a 9-cm heterogeneous enhancing mass in the distal tail of the pancreas without evidence of local invasion or metastatic disease, which was confirmed by pathological evaluation indicating extensive amyloid deposition and no signs of malignancy."
