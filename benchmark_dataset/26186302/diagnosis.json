        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ADHR was confirmed through molecular genetic analysis revealing a heterozygous mutation in the FGF23 gene. The patient presented with classic symptoms such as short stature, rickets, and biochemical abnormalities consistent with phosphate wasting, responding positively to treatments aimed at correcting iron deficiency and improving biochemical profiles."
