        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients were examined for adrenal masses initially suspected to be pheochromocytomas due to their history of MEN2 syndromes. However, pathological examination following surgical resection confirmed the presence of mature ganglioneuromas without evidence of pheochromocytoma. Additionally, imaging characteristics and the absence of catecholamine excess further supported the diagnosis of ganglioneuroma instead of pheochromocytoma."
