        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia was supported by clinical observations of skeletal abnormalities, hypercalcemia, and confirmed PTHR1 mutations, specifically the H223R mutation identified in the majority of patients. Laboratory findings indicated varying calcium levels and persistent hypercalciuria, which were integral in corroborating the diagnosis."
