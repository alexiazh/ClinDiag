    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency due to the Cytochrome b5 Mutation W27X",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a homozygous W27X mutation in the CYB5 gene, leading to a premature stop codon that resulted in deficient 17,20-lyase activity. Hormone analysis showed inconsistent testosterone levels after hCG stimulation, and elevated LH levels indicated a deficiency in androgen production, consistent with isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency."
