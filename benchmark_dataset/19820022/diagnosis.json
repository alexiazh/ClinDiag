    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Severe hypertriglyceridemia due to a novel LMF1 nonsense mutation (W464X)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a novel homozygous nonsense mutation (W464X) in the LMF1 gene was confirmed through genetic analysis, which is known to be involved in lipoprotein lipase maturation. The patient exhibited severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Reduced LPL activity (76% compared to controls) and a good response to treatment further supported the diagnosis."
