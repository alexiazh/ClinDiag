        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of early-onset obesity, severe hyperphagia, and neonatal onset enteropathy in the patient. Direct sequencing revealed a homozygous novel missense mutation (Ser307Leu) in the PC1/3 gene, which has been previously associated with impaired prohormone processing and was found not in 100 control alleles from subjects of Arab origin."
