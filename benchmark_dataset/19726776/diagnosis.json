        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation after a stressful event, along with the electrocardiogram findings of ST-segment elevations and deep T-wave inversions, suggests a significant myocardial process. However, the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease during left heart catheterization, coupled with characteristic wall-motion abnormalities on ventriculogram, confirmed the diagnosis of apical ballooning syndrome. Elevated cardiac biomarkers were consistent with myocardial injury but not with a complete occlusion, indicating other cardiovascular conditions must also be considered."
