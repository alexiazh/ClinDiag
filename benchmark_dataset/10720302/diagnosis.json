        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the episodes of confusion and myoclonic jerks, the positive family history for generalized epilepsy, normal neurologic examination and cranial imaging, and the presence of generalized polyspike-and-wave discharges on EEG. The prolonged alteration in mental state and seizure activity indicated myoclonic status epilepticus."
