        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a firm, painless mass that was initially thought to be a soft-tissue sarcoma. Imaging showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass, and histological analysis revealed a granulomatous response with thick-walled cryptococcal organisms. A positive cryptococcal titer and further staining solidified the diagnosis, distinguishing it from malignancy."
