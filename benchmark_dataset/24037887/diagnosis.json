        "final_diagnosis": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PJS was confirmed through genetic testing identifying a heterozygous mutation in the STK11 gene. Clinical features included prepubertal gynecomastia and advanced bone age, which are consistent with the effects of estrogen excess in patients with PJS. Loss of heterozygosity of the STK11 gene was demonstrated in testicular biopsies, correlating with increased aromatase expression in Sertoli cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed symptoms."
