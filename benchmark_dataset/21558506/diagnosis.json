        "final_diagnosis": "breast cancer (triple-negative breast cancer, grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with an asymptomatic lump in her left axilla. Mammography did not reveal the cancer due to dense breast tissue, but MRI showed a mass in the left breast and suspicious axillary nodes. Pathological examination confirmed a 1.5-cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma that was triple-negative (lacking ER, PR, and HER2 expression). This type of breast cancer is commonly associated with BRCA1 mutations, which the patient tested positive for."
