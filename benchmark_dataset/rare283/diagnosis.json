        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Postpartum maternal infection screening revealed a previously unknown T. gondii infection in the mother. Maternal serology indicated a primary infection during pregnancy, with proof of Toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies and increasing titers of specific IgA and IgG antibodies. The IgG avidity was low, and subsequent testing of the child indicated significant Toxoplasma-specific antibody responses, including positive PCR results from CSF. This evidence supports the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis."
