        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with dysphagia, bulbar weakness, and dyspnea, leading to a suspicion of a neuromuscular condition. MRI was normal, making infectious or granulomatous processes in the brain less likely. Testing confirmed myotonic dystrophy type 1 through PCR analysis showing 130 CTG repeats, aligning with clinical symptoms including facial and bulbar weakness, aspiration noted during swallow studies, and a history of early cataracts."
