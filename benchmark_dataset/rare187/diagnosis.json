        "final_diagnosis": "Microvillus inclusion disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Microvillus inclusion disease was supported by the clinical presentation of profound diarrhea, failure to thrive, and dependence on total parenteral nutrition. The stool characteristics, such as high fecal output and osmotic gap, along with histological findings of moderate villous blunting and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, coupled with the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions and abnormal staining patterns confirmed the diagnosis. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous mutation in the MYO5B gene, which is associated with this condition."
