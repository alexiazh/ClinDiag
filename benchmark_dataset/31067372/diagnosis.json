        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "MHL diagnosis was supported by pathological examination, which revealed fibrous and myxoid mesenchymal stroma with epithelial-lined cysts, as well as the presence of specific mutations in the DICER1 gene. The lack of other common causes associated with MHL (such as aberrant C19MC activation) further corroborated the diagnosis."
