        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through a coagulation workup that showed an elevated serum homocysteine level of 63.6 ÂµM/L, consistent with moderate homocystinuria. The patient's history of recurrent thrombosis and the findings of microthrombi and atherosclerosis in subsequent evaluations supported the diagnosis."
