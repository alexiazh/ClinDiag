        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of tremor and cerebellar ataxia, underwent genetic testing which confirmed an FMR1 gene premutation, and showed white matter lesions and moderate/severe generalized brain atrophy on MRI, fulfilling criteria for probable FXTAS. Despite multiple medication trials without significant improvement, bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) provided long-term control of tremor and improvement in ataxia."
