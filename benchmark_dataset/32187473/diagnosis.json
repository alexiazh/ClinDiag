    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Aspergillus terreus infection associated with toxic effects induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (pneumonitis, colitis, and motor axonal neuropathy) and metastatic melanoma without evidence of active disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pulmonary complications related to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, lymphangitic spread of melanoma, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, myocarditis, other infectious causes of diarrhea",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of severe hypoxemia and diffuse interstitial opacities in the context of recent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy was indicative of pneumonitis. Negative tests for infectious pathogens and imaging data supported this diagnosis, and the persistence of severe diarrhea suggested colitis due to the same therapy. The rapid progression of symptoms, alongside autopsy findings, confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated Aspergillus terreus infection."
