        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed bilateral pheochromocytoma, which was biochemically confirmed by high plasma and urinary metanephrines. Six years later, suspicion of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) arose when calcitonin levels became elevated. Exome sequencing identified a novel 6-base-pair deletion in exon 7 of the RET gene (p.505_506del), which is associated with increased ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, demonstrating its pathogenicity and confirming the diagnosis of MEN2A."
