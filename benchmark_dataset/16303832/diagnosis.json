        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The family's pedigree suggested an autosomal dominant trait, but molecular analysis identified a heterozygous R567X mutation in PHEX, indicating an X-linked dominant trait. The father was found to be a somatic and germline mosaic for this mutation, further supporting the diagnosis."
