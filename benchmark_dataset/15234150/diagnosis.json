        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the clinical findings of retinal hemorrhages and subdural hematomas after minor trauma in three patients with confirmed type I Osteogenesis Imperfecta. All cases were thoroughly investigated by child protection teams which did not find evidence of abuse, concluding that the injuries were consistent with accidental injuries due to the patients' underlying condition."
