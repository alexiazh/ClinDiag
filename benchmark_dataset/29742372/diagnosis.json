        "final_diagnosis": "Indian tick typhus caused by Rickettsia conorii subspecies indica",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Viral hemorrhagic fevers, small-vessel vasculitis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsial infection",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Indian tick typhus was made based on the patient's history of travel to India, exposure to ticks, the presence of a purpuric rash, anterior uveitis, hyponatremia, and compatible clinical features. Serologic tests indicated positive IgG antibodies to rickettsiae of the spotted fever group, and PCR assays showed a positive result for Rickettsia in whole blood. The absence of fever and the timeline of symptom onset aligned with the infection."
