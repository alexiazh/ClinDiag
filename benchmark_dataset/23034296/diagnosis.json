        "differential_diagnosis": "sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by positive PCR findings for M tuberculosis from a vitreous sample, the presence of activated macrophages/microglia in a granuloma, and a reported history of tuberculosis contact. Sarcoidosis was ruled out due to the absence of systemic or radiological features, while parasites were ruled out based on the absence of specific immune cells."
