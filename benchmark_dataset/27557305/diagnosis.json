        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Pathological and cytologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a giant-cell tumor of bone. The patient exhibited characteristic symptoms and imaging findings associated with this diagnosis, including pain and a destructive lesion of the lumbar spine. The differential diagnoses considered included brown tumor, giant-cell reparative granuloma, and chondroblastoma, with osteosarcoma as the most important entity to rule out, but the biopsy did not indicate malignant features typical for osteosarcoma."
