        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of inhalation anthrax was supported by the positive blood cultures growing gram-positive rods, identified as Bacillus anthracis, along with clinical symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain after potential exposure to contaminated animal hides. Additionally, the presence of lethal factor and anti-protective antigen immunoglobulin G in serum and pleural fluid further confirmed the diagnosis."
