The cysts formed large conglomerates and were covered with multiple filiform hyperkeratoses and comedo-like plugs. One cyst in the sacral area was inflamed and released malodorous material.",
            "changes_over_time": "The lumps increased in number and size with age, leading to some being excised due to inflammation and fistula formation. Additionally, by 26 years of age, the patient became wheelchair-bound due to severe arthrosis and leg bowing."
