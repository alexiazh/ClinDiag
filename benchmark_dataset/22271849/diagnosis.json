        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a missense mutation in the transthyretin gene, low sensory nerve action potential and motor nerve conduction velocity, amyloid deposition in the biopsied gastroduodenal mucosa, and echocardiographic findings of significantly thickened ventricular walls, along with robust retention of [11C]-BF-227 indicating amyloid deposition in the myocardium."
