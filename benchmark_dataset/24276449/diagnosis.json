        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of somatic HIF2A mutations in both patients, which disrupt the hydroxylation domain of the HIF2 protein, and confirmation of polycythemia through blood volume measurements. The patients' clinical history of multiple tumors, including pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, further supported the diagnostic conclusion."
