        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient displayed a range of symptoms including urinary retention, perianal pain, and abdominal pain, which were investigated through physical examinations and imaging studies. Initial CT scans revealed fluid collections and subsequent diagnostic laparoscopy identified a cystic lesion lined with colonic mucosa. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis, leading to the conclusion of rectal duplication as the final diagnosis."
