        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The definitive diagnosis of Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) was made by dystrophin gene analysis, which revealed deletion of exons 45 to 47. Additional findings included muscle atrophy, a positive Gowersâ€™s sign, and results from an electromyogram showing a typical myopathic pattern. Electrocardiography and cardiac ultrasound suggested mild left ventricular dysfunction, while blood tests indicated the absence of overt cardiac failure."
