        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with new-onset focal motor seizures and generalized motor seizures, attributed to cortical-vein thrombosis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Key imaging findings included ischemic injury, vasogenic edema, and evidence of thrombosis. Additional signs, such as tall stature, developmental delays, and downward lens dislocation, aligned with homocystinuria, leading to elevated homocysteine levels confirming the diagnosis."
