        "differential_diagnosis": "Acromegaly, amyloidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy was based on the presence of skin changes, digital clubbing, and underlying pulmonary pathology from a solitary fibrous tumor confirmed by imaging and biopsy. The patient's symptomatic hypoglycemia and resolution of symptoms after pneumonectomy further supported the diagnosis."
