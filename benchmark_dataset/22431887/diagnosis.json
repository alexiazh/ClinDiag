        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of severe retrosternal chest pain, nausea, and palpitations began after consuming energy drinks mixed with alcohol. An emergent coronary angiogram revealed a large thrombus in the left main coronary artery with significant occlusion, while no atherosclerotic lesions were identified. Troponin I levels were elevated prior to coronary bypass graft surgery, supporting the diagnosis of acute coronary thrombosis."
