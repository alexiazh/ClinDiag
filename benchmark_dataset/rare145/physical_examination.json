            "relevant_findings": "Manual muscle testing showed grade 3/4 on the right and left knees. The range of motion (ROM) was 20°-150°, and the patella was laterally dislocated during knee flexion. Severe genu valgum of the right knee with a hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAa) of valgus 29.0°, grade IV osteoarthritic changes in the lateral femorotibial compartment, and laterally dislocated patella. Dysplasia of the lateral femoral condyle, dysplasia of the trochlea with a sulcus angle of 150°, laterally located patella, and a tibial tuberosity to trochlear groove distance of 41.3 mm.",
            "changes_over_time": "At postoperative day 21, the ROM was 10°-110° and HKAa was corrected to valgus 16° on the right and left knees. At 1-year follow-up, the knee ROM was 5°-125° with HKAa of valgus 13° and 17°. Annual follow-ups showed almost fixed-knee ROM (10°-125°) with HKAa of valgus 11° and 16°. At the latest follow-up (5 years), the ROM improved to 10°-135° with an extension lag of 10°, and no evidence of loosening or fracture was observed."
