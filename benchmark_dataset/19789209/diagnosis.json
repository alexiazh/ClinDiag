        "final_diagnosis": "Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) due to a novel loss-of-function mutation in the CASR gene (Q459R)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary Hyperparathyroidism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The index case presented with hypercalcemia and low urinary calcium excretion, suggesting FHH. Although primary hyperparathyroidism was initially suspected due to elevated PTH levels, the combination of hypercalcemia, inappropriately elevated PTH, and low fractional excretion of calcium led to the eventual diagnosis of FHH, confirmed by identification of a homozygous CASR mutation."
