        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction, including itching, erythema, cough, asthma, and edema after using latex gloves. A positive specific IgE for latex and a severe systemic reaction during a skin prick test for cypress—indicating a possible cross-reactivity between latex and cypress antigens—led to the final diagnosis."
