        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with significant clinical features including eruptive xanthomas, marked hypertriglyceridemia, and progressive fat loss. Despite prior interventions with lipid-lowering agents and dietary modifications, the triglyceride levels remained extremely high, leading to the decision for intensive plasma exchange therapy, which showed dramatic improvement in symptoms and laboratory parameters."
