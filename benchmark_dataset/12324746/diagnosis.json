        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Clinical symptoms and chest radiographic abnormalities were suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis; however, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were negative for mycobacteria. A transbronchial lung biopsy revealed a druse of Mucor, leading to a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary mucormycosis."
