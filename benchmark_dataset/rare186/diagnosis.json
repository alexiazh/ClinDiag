        "final_diagnosis": "McCune-Albright syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of McCune-Albright syndrome is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including multiple skin pigmentations at birth, a history of skeletal abnormalities, and the results of imaging studies showing bone lesions consistent with fibrous dysplasia. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels further indicate metabolic bone disease associated with this syndrome. Postoperative histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia, which is characteristic of McCune-Albright syndrome."
