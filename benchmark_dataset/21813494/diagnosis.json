        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. H reported a 3-week history of depressed mood, anhedonia, decreased appetite, insomnia, and thoughts of suicide, with a history of increased marijuana use temporally associated with her suicide attempts. While a substance-induced mood disorder couldn't be definitively excluded, her history and presentation primarily aligned with recurrent major depressive disorder and cannabis dependence."
