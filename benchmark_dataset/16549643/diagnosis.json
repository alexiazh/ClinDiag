        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on clinical findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which showed thickened left ventricular wall, pronounced delayed hyperenhancement in hypertrophied muscle areas, and histological evidence of myocardial disarray and fibrosis, typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the absence of an intraventricular pressure gradient during catheterization supported the nonobstructive nature of the condition."
