        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited progressive symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) and had severe obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms that persisted for over 10 years. The decision to perform bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation was supported by the significant improvement in both PD and OCD symptoms following the procedure, with specific scales indicating dramatic reductions in symptom severity post-surgery."
