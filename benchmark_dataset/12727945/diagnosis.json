        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Kallmann Syndrome was supported by the presentation of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by low testosterone, FSH, and LH levels, coupled with symptoms of anosmia and MRI findings indicating hypoplastic olfactory bulbs. The condition is confirmed by the presence of an intragenic deletion in the KAL-1 gene in the affected siblings, demonstrating phenotypic variability including hearing loss, renal aplasia, and unique craniofacial features."
