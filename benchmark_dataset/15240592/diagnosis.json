        "final_diagnosis": "idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to GNRHR mutations",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient demonstrated isolated gonadotropin deficiency, characterized by low levels of LH and FSH despite normal sense of smell and normal imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region. The sequence analysis of the GNRHR gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations resulting in significant alterations in receptor function, which correlated with the patient's clinical presentation of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Additionally, the distinct gonadotropin response to pulsatile GnRH therapy indicated an abnormality in receptor sensitivity and function."
