        "differential_diagnosis": "Richter’s transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, infectious lymphadenitis, infiltration of lymph nodes by melanoma.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms inconsistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) alone, including rapidly progressive right inguinal lymphadenopathy, unexplained fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. Core biopsy revealed isolated herpes simplex virus infection, while imaging showed high FDG avidity in the lymph nodes, leading to the concern for Richter’s transformation but ultimately confirming HSV lymphadenitis."
