        "final_diagnosis": "Adrenal Cushing's syndrome secondary to a left adrenal tumor",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary hyperaldosteronism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of adrenal Cushing's syndrome was supported by endocrinological findings such as increased cortisol secretion without a circadian rhythm and suppression of plasma ACTH. Imaging studies, including CT, revealed a mass in the left adrenal gland, and the resected specimen confirmed the presence of an adrenal adenoma."
