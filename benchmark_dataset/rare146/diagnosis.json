        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital primary megaureter, refluxing and obstructed form",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with an enlarged abdomen and pain, especially on the left side, which prompted radiological examinations. US and CT urography revealed cystic masses and pelvocalyectasis of the left kidney, while MRI showed a thick-walled cystic mass connected to the pelvicalyceal system without distal obstruction. VCUG did not show reflux. Surgical findings included an enlarged, tortuous left ureter, confirming the diagnosis of megaureter."
