        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of prosopometamorphopsia was based on the patient's lifelong history of seeing faces transform into dragon-like features, her full insight into the hallucinations, and the absence of abnormalities in neurological examination, blood tests, and EEG. MRI showed white-matter abnormalities which could be contributing to her symptoms, and her experiences were attributed to aberrant electrophysiological activity in brain regions specialized for face and color perception."
