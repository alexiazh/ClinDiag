        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Histological examination showed features characteristic of a meningioma with infiltration of soft tissues, moderate nuclear atypia, mitotic figures, and areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the meningothelial nature of the cells and excluded other tumors. The tumor's aggressive nature and extensive local invasion into the brachial plexus and thoracic cavity supported the diagnosis of atypical meningioma."
