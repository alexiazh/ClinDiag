        "final_diagnosis": "Neurofibromatosis type 1, with multiple spinal neurofibromas",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presents with multiple neurofibromas causing weakness and pain, with MRI showing large lesions on cervical nerve roots and no typical MRI signs of neurofibromatosis type 2 or other related conditions. The patient also lacks the requisite number of caf√©-au-lait spots for classic neurofibromatosis type 1, suggesting a variant form. The presence of these characteristics suggests neurofibromatosis type 1, likely similar to familial spinal neurofibromatosis."
