        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of complete generalized glucocorticoid resistance was supported by severe clinical symptoms from the first day of life, including profound hypoglycemia, persistent high cortisol and ACTH levels despite high doses of dexamethasone, and the identification of a homozygous mutation in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) that resulted in lack of dexamethasone binding and biological effect."
