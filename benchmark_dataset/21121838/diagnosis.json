        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the elevated serum calcitriol level, low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), alongside clinical symptoms of hypercalcemia, renal failure, and anemia. Tissue biopsy confirmed the presence of malignant Reedâ€“Sternberg cells consistent with Hodgkin's lymphoma."
