        "differential_diagnosis": "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of a pyogenic brain abscess was supported by the patient's symptoms, the presence of a rapidly enlarging ring-enhancing lesion in the right posterior cingulate gyrus, and the initial microbial findings confirming Streptococcus anginosus and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The context of her recent dental procedure and a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation suggested a hematogenous spread of infection. The symptoms' sudden onset and progressive nature were indicative of an infectious process rather than a tumor."
