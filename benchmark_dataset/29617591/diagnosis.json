        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of progressive fatigue, confusion, and elevated blood pressure, along with the CT and MRI findings indicating extensive white-matter edema and mass effect, supports the diagnosis of PRES due to obstructive nephropathy, likely exacerbated by his benign prostatic hyperplasia. The absence of signs for infectious or inflammatory processes helped refine the diagnosis."
