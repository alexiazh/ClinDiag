        "final_diagnosis": "Multifocal intrafollicular granulosa cell tumor of the ovary",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a 7 cm multicystic mass in the right ovary, histological findings of intrafollicular growth with bizarre TP53 positive nuclei, abundant mitoses, and the detection of a germline p53 mutation in the patient. The tumor exhibited a unique multifocal presentation, and the absence of similar case reports or familial cancer history further supported the diagnosis."
