        "diagnostic_reasoning": "This 16-year-old girl presented with symptoms following a sailing accident, including dizziness, confusion, and headache. She lost consciousness for a few minutes and exhibited signs consistent with concussion. The diagnosis of concussion was supported by her symptoms, a history of a previous concussion, and the results of a physical examination which indicated vestibular and ocular dysfunction. The identification of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo came from her description of dizziness and examination findings, while attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder was diagnosed based on historical inattention and hyperactivity symptoms present since childhood."
