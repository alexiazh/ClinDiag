        "final_diagnosis": "Familial Holoprosencephaly due to Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) Mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on the detection of a Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) nonsense mutation (Glu256stop) in DNA samples obtained from an affected child, whose clinical signs included severe holoprosencephaly and cleft lip and palate. The mutation was not found in the parents' genomic DNA, suggesting a new gonadal mutation in one of them. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis allowed for the identification of mutation-free embryos, ultimately leading to the birth of a healthy girl."
