Of these, seven appeared to contain the mutant allele; only one embryo was free of the mutation and was transferred back but yielded no clinical pregnancy. In the second cycle, 10 embryos were acceptable for biopsy, and only one failed to amplify. The remaining nine were tested for the SHH gene and linked markers.",
