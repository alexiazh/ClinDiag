        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on the presence of undetectable cortisol levels, low growth hormone (GH) levels during hypoglycemic episodes, and the resolution of GH deficiency after glucocorticoid replacement, as well as targeted molecular investigations revealing mutations in MRAP and TPIT."
