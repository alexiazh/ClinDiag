        "final_diagnosis": "Embolic basilar-artery stroke associated with a patent foramen ovale.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebellar abscess, posterior fossa tumor, brain-stem encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The rapid onset of symptoms including ataxia, dysarthria, and coma, along with MRI findings of restricted diffusion in the basis pontis and signs of basilar-artery occlusion, supported a diagnosis of cerebral embolism leading to ischemic stroke. Differentials such as cerebellar abscess and tumors were considered but deemed unlikely due to the lack of fever, leukocytosis, and rapid progression of symptoms."
