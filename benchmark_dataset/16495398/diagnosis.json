        "final_diagnosis": "Metastatic breast cancer",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Invasive transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder; ovarian cancer; primary cancers of cervix or endometrium",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute urinary incontinence and imaging revealed bilateral solid ovarian masses, thickened bladder wall, and an infiltrating bladder mass at cystoscopy. Pathological examination of the bladder tumor suggested characteristics of metastatic breast cancer rather than transitional-cell carcinoma. The patient's extensive family history of breast and ovarian cancers, along with her previous breast cancer history, added further suspicion to metastatic disease, and a biopsy confirmed metastatic breast carcinoma."
