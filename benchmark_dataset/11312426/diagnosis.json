        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of NBCCS was supported by the presence of multiple pedunculated papules resembling acrochordons that, upon biopsy, revealed basal cell carcinomas. The clinical findings, such as skin tags in young children, provided an early indication of NBCCS, allowing for timely sun protection measures and monitoring for further tumor development."
