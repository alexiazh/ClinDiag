        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's presentation of severe bone pain and multiple lytic bone lesions observed on imaging studies. The absence of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and the lack of significant findings for systemic mastocytosis guided the diagnosis towards an epithelioid spindle-cell tumor. Histologic examination revealed tumor characteristics consistent with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, supported by immunohistochemical findings and the negative t(1;3) translocation typically associated with this tumor."
