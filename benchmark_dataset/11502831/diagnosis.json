        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome was based on the presence of the classical triad of sensorineural deafness and goiter, along with positive perchlorate discharge tests in the index cases. Radiological findings of enlarged vestibular aqueducts (EVA) were consistently observed in the affected individuals, and molecular analysis revealed novel mutations in the Pendrin gene (PDS), confirming the diagnosis."
