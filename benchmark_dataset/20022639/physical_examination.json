            "changes_over_time": "In case 1, multiple recurrences occurred over time. In case 2, mild ipsilateral proptosis developed leading to further surgeries. Case 3 had recurrences noted after various orbitotomies. In case 4, progressive diplopia and proptosis worsened over time before successful treatment without recurrence. Case 5 showed no improvement with initial steroid treatment; worsening proptosis noted four months later. Case 6 had progressive symptoms of diplopia and blurriness."
