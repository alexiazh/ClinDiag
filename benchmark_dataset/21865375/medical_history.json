        "history_of_present_illness": "Patient 1 was diagnosed at age 4 with hypocalcemic seizures despite treatment, showing repeated seizures (five per year) and fluctuations in calcium levels. Poor therapeutic compliance was suspected, and treatment was escalated to continuous subcutaneous administration of rhPTH1-34 at age 8 due to persistent low serum calcium levels (1.4â€“1.8 mmol/liter) after the rhPTH1-34 injections. Patient 2 was diagnosed at age 11 with similar symptoms and was treated with the same regimen as his brother. Patient 3 was diagnosed at age 11 with hypocalcemic seizures, needing multiple hospital admissions due to hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia.",
        "past_medical_history": "Patient 1 and Patient 2 have APECED syndrome with hypoparathyroidism due to a homozygous mutation in the AIRE gene. Patient 3 had recurrent hypocalcemic seizures with no known mutations.",
        "family_history": "Both patients 1 and 2 are brothers, with relevant family history being APECED syndrome. Patient 3 has no similar conditions reported in family history.",
