        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was established based on clinical symptoms, including hypocalcemic seizures and biochemical testing showing low calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. Genetic testing confirmed mutations associated with APECED syndrome in two patients, while the third patient lacked AIRE gene mutations. The refractory nature of their hypoparathyroidism to conventional treatment initiated consideration of continuous subcutaneous administration of recombinant human PTH (rhPTH1-34)."
