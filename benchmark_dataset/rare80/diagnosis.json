        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hepatic adenomatosis was based on imaging studies including ultrasound and MRI, which revealed multiple focal lesions in the liver that were suggestive of adenomas. Initial ultrasound suggested areas of focal fatty sparing, but subsequent MRI confirmed enlarged liver with diffuse fat infiltration and several adenomas, with monitoring showing no significant changes over time."
