    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1B syndrome due to EFEMP2 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of extensive arterial tortuosity, severe aortic dilation, and the patient's phenotype, including musculoskeletal features and family history, led to whole-exome sequencing which identified a known homozygous mutation of p.Glu57Lys in the EFEMP2 gene. This mutation is associated with cutis laxa type 1B syndrome and confirmed the diagnosis."
