        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a waxing and waning pleural effusion that was found incidentally during routine cancer screening, raising concerns for various causes, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. The subsequent development of symptoms such as uterine bleeding and pelvic fullness, along with imaging studies revealing a significant pelvic mass, shifted the focus towards malignancy. However, the absence of nodularity or lymphadenopathy on imaging and the proposed benign nature of the ovarian mass led to concluding it was likely due to the Demons–Meigs syndrome."
