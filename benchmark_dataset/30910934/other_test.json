            "date": "1999",
            "findings": "Light microscopy revealed 14 glomeruli with global sclerosis (in one glomerulus), segmental sclerosis (in two glomeruli), vessels with spheroidal hyaline degeneration (in two glomeruli), mesangial enlargement (in nine glomeruli), focal tubular atrophy, segmental fibrous proliferation, and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the tubulointerstitium but no lesions of small vessels. Immunofluorescence showed scattered mesangial deposits of both IgA (++) and IgM (+) but without deposits of IgG, C3, C4, C1q, fibrin, k, and l in five glomeruli.",
            "changes_over_time": "Renal biopsy performed for the second time in 2002 revealed nine glomeruli with segmental sclerosis (in one glomerulus), mild segmental mesangial proliferation (in eight glomeruli), renal tubular atrophy, focal fibrous proliferation, and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the tubulointerstitium but no lesions in small vessels. Immunofluorescence showed scattered mesangial deposits of IgA (+++) but without deposit of IgM, IgG, C3, C4, C1q, fibrin, k, and l in five glomeruli. Electron microscopy showed effacement of podocyte foot processes, partial thickened and sclerosing glomerular basement membrane, mesangial hypercellularity, and subendothelial deposition of an electron dense material."
