        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of SRNS was based on the identification of compound-heterozygous mutations in the NUP160 gene (NUP160R11733 and NUP160E803K) in a young girl. Genetic testing ruled out mutations associated with SRNS in other genes, and functional validation studies using a Drosophila model indicated that these NUP160 mutations were pathogenic, affecting nephrocyte function and morphology."
