        "differential_diagnosis": "Cerebellar tumor, Cerebral venous thrombosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe cerebellar edema and neurological symptoms that could mimic a cerebellar tumor; however, the history of lead ingestion and the resolution of symptoms after chelation therapy supported the diagnosis of lead poisoning. Additional findings such as predominantly motor axonal polyneuropathy further supported lead toxicity."
