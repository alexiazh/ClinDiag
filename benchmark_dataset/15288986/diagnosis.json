        "differential_diagnosis": "Ocular-cicatricial pemphigoid",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Bilateral corneal and conjunctival inflammation and scarring were noted, which mimicked ocular-cicatricial pemphigoid. The patient had a long history of hydrogen peroxide use as an eye wash, leading to severe ocular damage and formation of a descemetocele, necessitating emergency surgical intervention."
