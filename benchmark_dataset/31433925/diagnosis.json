        "final_diagnosis": "Opioid use disorder and malingering.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Somatic symptom and related disorders, personality disorder, major depressive disorder, acute mania, factitious disorder.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a self-reported suicide attempt and showed evidence of substance abuse, particularly opioids. Despite initial reports of ingestion of glass, imaging did not confirm this, raising suspicion about the truthfulness of her narratives. Episodes of elbow dislocation coincided with desires for opioid medication, indicating a possible pattern of malingering driven by the need for opioids. Malingering was confirmed after psychiatric evaluation revealed the patient had lied about her suicide attempt and intentionally dislocated her elbows to obtain opioids."
