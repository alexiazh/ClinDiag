        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of LPL deficiency was confirmed by the absence of LPL mass and activity in postheparin plasma, along with genetic confirmation of a one-base deletion in the LPL gene (LPL Arita). The patient presented with severe hyperchylomicronemia and a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis, but preserved pancreatic endocrine function over a long clinical follow-up."
