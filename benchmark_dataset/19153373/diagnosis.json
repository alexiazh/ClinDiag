        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A family history indicated autosomal dominant inheritance. The presence of extensive subcortical gliosis and lack of tau/ubiquitin inclusions distinguished this case from other forms of frontotemporal dementia. Clinical and imaging evaluations, including progressive behavioral decline and white matter changes evident on MRI, contributed to the final diagnosis."
