        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Five asymptomatic carriers of germ-line truncating mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy. Microscopic analysis revealed infiltrates of malignant signet-ring cells, confirming early diffuse gastric cancer, which was not identifiable on gross examination or previous endoscopies."
