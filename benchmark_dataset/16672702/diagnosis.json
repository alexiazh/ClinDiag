        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with profound T-cell deficiency, recurrent infections, and specific laboratory findings indicating low T-cell counts and normal B-cell counts. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous Q70X mutation in the CD3ζ gene, necessary for T-cell receptor complex function and signaling, confirming the diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency."
