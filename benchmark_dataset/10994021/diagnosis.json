        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the abrupt worsening of the patient's epilepsy characterized by daily complex partial seizures (CPS) and visual auras following an increase in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) current. Video EEG telemetry confirmed increased seizure frequency and recorded a new seizure type. The patient's habitual seizures subsided when VNS was turned off, suggesting a direct association between VNS stimulation levels and seizure activity."
