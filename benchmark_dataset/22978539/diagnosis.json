    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Hybrid peripheral nerve sheath tumor",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with multiple painful tumors that exhibited hybrid features of both neurofibromas and schwannomas. Genetic testing revealed negative results for mutations associated with NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. Clinically, the patient's tumors did not exhibit features consistent with NF1 or NF2, nor did they meet the criteria for schwannomatosis. The tumors displayed distinct morphological characteristics during histopathological examination, leading to the conclusion of a novel presentation of hybrid tumors."
