        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Shigella sonnei bacteremia was supported by the isolation of S. sonnei from blood cultures, which was confirmed with conventional biochemical methods. The patient presented with adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure, indicating a severe systemic infection, despite the absence of typical preceding gastrointestinal symptoms commonly associated with Shigella infections."
