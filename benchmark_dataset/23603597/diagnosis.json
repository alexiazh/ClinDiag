        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The case involved imaging (99mTc-MDP bone scan and 18F-FDG PET/CT) showing increased tracer uptake in the femur, initially suggesting recurrent osteosarcoma. However, histological examination revealed osteoid production and hypercellular spindle cell proliferation without pleomorphism or cellular atypia, characteristic of florid reactive periostitis ossificans."
