        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia was supported by the detection of a de novo heterozygous CASR gene mutation, low parathyroid hormone levels, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Seizures and abnormal movements were managed with antiepileptic medications until resolution, and ongoing management included monitoring serum calcium levels and adjusting calcitriol doses."
