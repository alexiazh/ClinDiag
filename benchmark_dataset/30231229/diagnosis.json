            "Müllerian aplasia",
            "Complete XY gonadal dysgenesis",

            "Leydig-cell hypoplasia"
        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The absence of uterus and cervix, normal vaginal length, and female external genitalia, along with the low FSH levels in the context of elevated LH, are consistent with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XY karyotype and elevated levels of antimüllerian hormone supported this diagnosis."
