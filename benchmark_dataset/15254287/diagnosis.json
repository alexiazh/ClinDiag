        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of travel to Kenya, symptoms of fever and cough, presence of pericardial effusion and tamponade, along with the positive tuberculin skin test after admission, suggested a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Other infections and malignancies were considered, but negative cultures and specific characteristics of her condition pointed towards tuberculous pericarditis as the most likely cause."
