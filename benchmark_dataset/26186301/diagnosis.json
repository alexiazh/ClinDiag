        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a homozygous c.309C/H11022A substitution in the leptin gene, resulting in the p.N103K amino acid exchange, along with detectable circulating levels of leptin. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutated leptin protein was biologically inactive, leading to hyperphagia and rapid weight gain in the affected siblings."
