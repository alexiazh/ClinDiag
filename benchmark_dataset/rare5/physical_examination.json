The vortex vibratory urticaria/angioedema provocation test was positive showing a 0.5-cm increase in the mid-forearm perimeter, intense pruritus, increased local temperature, localized hives beginning 3 minutes after the cessation of the stimulus, lasting 20 minutes, and an oedematous plaque coinciding with the vortex edge, at the area where the vibration was maximum, which could be observed 5 hours later.
