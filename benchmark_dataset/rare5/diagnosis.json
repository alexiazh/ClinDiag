        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of vibratory angioedema was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of episodic hand and feet swellings, large oedematous plaques following vibration exposure, and a positive vortex vibratory urticaria/angioedema provocation test. Additionally, the patient's history of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) and the absence of symptoms related to other physical agents further supported this diagnosis."
