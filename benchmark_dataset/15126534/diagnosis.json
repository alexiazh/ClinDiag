        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation (R947X) in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (MR), resulting in a truncated receptor with no aldosterone binding capability. The clinical presentation included renal salt loss, elevated plasma renin activity, and hyperkalemia in the index patient, while the father carried the same mutation but remained asymptomatic, indicating incomplete penetrance."
