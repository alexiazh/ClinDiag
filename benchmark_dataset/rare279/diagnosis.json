        "final_diagnosis": "Oral submucous fibrosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Oral submucous fibrosis was supported by the patient's history of progressive trismus, difficulty in eating, and an intraoral examination revealing blanching of the mucosa, hardened texture, and striations. MRI findings showed thickening of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and abnormal signals at the base of the tongue, which contributed to the diagnosis. Surgical intervention confirmed the presence of oropharyngeal stenosis."
