        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary myelofibrosis, ovarian serous cystadenoma, hemochromatosis, Wilsonâ€™s disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Turner syndrome was confirmed through chromosome analysis revealing 45, X/46, XX. The patient's clinical presentation included characteristic physical features such as short stature, webbed neck, and other related anomalies. Initial test results and imaging indicated multiple complications, including cirrhosis and a cystic mass on the ovary, but the key determinant for the diagnosis was the chromosomal findings."
