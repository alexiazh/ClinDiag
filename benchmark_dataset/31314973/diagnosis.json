        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited chronic progressive weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, and elevated creatine kinase levels, which are consistent with rhabdomyolysis. However, the high titer of autoantibodies to HMGCR and the biopsy findings revealed macrophage infiltration without necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of statin-associated autoimmune myopathy instead of other causes."
