        "final_diagnosis": "Myeloid sarcoma of the ear, with recurrent otitis media and externa, in a patient with essential thrombocythemia.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Acute otitis media, Chronic otitis media, Otitis externa, Tuberculous otitis media, Wegener’s granulomatosis, Sarcoidosis, Kimura’s disease, Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, Extramedullary hematopoiesis, Neoplasms including lymphoma, Myeloid sarcoma.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma was based on the persistent enlarging mass in the ear canal, along with recurrent otitis media and externa that did not respond to standard treatment. The imaging studies showed a hyperdense soft-tissue mass with preserved bony integrity, and histopathology confirmed the presence of myeloid markers. Further indications included the patient's history of essential thrombocythemia and findings of immature myeloid cells in blood tests."
