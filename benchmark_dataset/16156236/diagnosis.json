        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a tethered spinal cord and the development of self-mutilation behaviors concurrent with symptomatic tethering. The resolution of radicular chest and back pain, as well as the cessation of self-mutilation behaviors following detethering procedures, further substantiates this diagnosis."
