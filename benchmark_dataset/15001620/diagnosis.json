        "final_diagnosis": "Growth Hormone Insensitivity Syndrome (GHIS) due to a homozygous mutation in the Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR) resulting in a GHR truncated after Box1.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical findings of short stature, elevated growth hormone levels, and low levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in both siblings. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous 22-bp deletion in the GHR gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation that truncated the receptor, confirming the defect responsible for the observed growth hormone insensitivity."
