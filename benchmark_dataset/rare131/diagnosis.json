        "final_diagnosis": "Maternal phenylketonuria",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Plasma amino acid testing showed elevated phenylalanine levels (Phe) in the classic range at 1642 and 1492 Âµmol/L, respectively. Further, exome sequencing revealed the patient to be homozygous for a pathogenic variant in the PAH gene, confirming the diagnosis of maternal phenylketonuria. The familial history of phenylketonuria (PKU) in her brother and niece supports this diagnosis."
