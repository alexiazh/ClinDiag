        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included cardiac conduction system disease, progressive muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, and significant findings on muscle biopsy indicative of myofibrillar myopathy. Genetic testing confirmed a pathogenic variant R406W in the DES gene, unifying the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy with cardiac manifestations."
