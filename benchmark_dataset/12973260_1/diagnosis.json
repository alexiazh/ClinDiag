        "final_diagnosis": "Late pedicle obstruction in a free DIEP flap",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced ischemia of the reconstructed breast on postoperative day 15, with no signs of infection or trauma. The necrosis of the central and medial areas was attributed to late obstruction of the vascular anastomoses, which are supposed to be completely endothelialized by the fourth postoperative day. The patient's history of radiation therapy reduced the chances of flap survival due to poor vascularization."
