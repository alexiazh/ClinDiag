        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ocular metastases was supported by clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings indicating the presence of carcinoid tumors. Six patients with histologically confirmed carcinoid tumors were identified with ocular metastases, secondarily confirmed through biochemical evidence of the carcinoid syndrome in some cases, and imaging techniques such as scintigraphy with [111In]pentetreotide revealing uptake indicative of metastatic disease."
