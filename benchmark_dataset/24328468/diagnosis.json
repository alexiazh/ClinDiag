        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by the bilateral tender cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, leukopenia, and the findings from fine-needle aspiration biopsy showing a mixed lymphocyte population and crescentic histiocytes. The negative results for common infectious causes and the patient's recent travel history to India reduced the likelihood of other diagnoses like tuberculosis and lymphoma. Additionally, the patient's clinical presentation and biopsy results matched the characteristics of Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease."
