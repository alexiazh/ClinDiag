        "history_of_present_illness": "The older brother developed chronic constipation upon introducing solid foods around age 2. His condition worsened over time, leading to growth failure despite remaining active. He experienced acute volvulus of the large intestine at age 14, requiring right hemicolectomy, followed by small bowel obstruction, with subsequent partial resection and ileostomy. The younger brother developed PIPO at age 6, with a similar course, also experiencing acute volvulus and requiring surgery, becoming TPN-dependent around age 14. Both brothers are mostly dependent on TPN for nutrition, with some tolerance for oral food intake.",
