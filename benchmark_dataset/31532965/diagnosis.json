        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited a pattern of early vomiting and insufficient weight gain. Symptoms were aggravated by the introduction of solid foods, with eventual diagnosis supported by the presence of undigested food in vomitus, and the absence of improvement with treatments for GERD or dietary changes. Further diagnostic imaging revealed focal narrowing in the distal esophagus consistent with congenital esophageal stenosis."
