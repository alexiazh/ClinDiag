        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of IGHD II was made after identifying a heterozygous splice enhancer mutation (GH-E32A) in the GH-1 gene, which resulted in aberrant splicing and the production of a significantly increased amount of the 17.5-kDa GH isoform relative to wild-type GH. This mutation negatively impacted cell proliferation and GH production, aligning with the clinical presentation of growth retardation."
