    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Aromatase deficiency due to a novel homozygous mutation in the CYP19 gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited symptoms indicative of aromatase deficiency, including continued linear growth, diffuse bone pain, eunuchoid body proportions, and bilateral cryptorchidism. Hormonal evaluations and a liver biopsy confirmed the presence of a complex dysmetabolic syndrome comprising diabetes mellitus type 2, insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and liver steatosis. The identification of a novel homozygous mutation in the CYP19 gene further substantiated the diagnosis."
