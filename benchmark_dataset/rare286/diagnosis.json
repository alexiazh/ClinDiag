        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia was supported by the prenatal presentation of fetal non-immune edema and pleural effusion, persistent pulmonary hypertension after birth, and the chest radiograph indicating 'white lung.' Autopsy confirmed histopathological changes in the lungs showing a honeycomb pattern with dilated lymphatic vessels and immunohistochemical markers consistent with the diagnosis."
