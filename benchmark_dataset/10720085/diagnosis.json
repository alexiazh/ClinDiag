        "final_diagnosis": "Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) with predominance of prolactinomas",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of germ line mutations of the MEN1 gene and clinical manifestations including several family members diagnosed with prolactinomas led to the final diagnosis of MEN1. The first sister had a sparingly granulated PRL cell adenoma, and subsequent investigations revealed hyperparathyroidism and a nonfunctioning pancreatic tumor in other family members, consistent with the phenotype of MEN1."
