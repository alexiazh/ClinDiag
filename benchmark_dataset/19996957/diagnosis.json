        "final_diagnosis": "Postoperative delirium due to postoperative peritonitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, opioid withdrawal, nicotine withdrawal",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's postoperative delirium was linked to fever and a confirmed 3-cm fluid collection at the colorectal anastomosis indicating postoperative peritonitis. The presence of disorientation, confusion, and logorrhea along with physical findings supported the diagnosis. Benzodiazepine and opioid withdrawal were considered due to the patient's chronic use and the cessation of medications in the postoperative period."
