        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through genetic testing for Munc 13-4, along with clinical findings of acute kidney injury (AKI) attributed to direct inflammatory injury to the kidney, characterized by massive infiltration of activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells in the renal parenchyma. Additionally, the patient responded positively to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, which improved renal function."
