        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia was supported by the patient's severe anemia, clinical presentation of marked weakness and fatigue, previous history of anemia requiring multiple blood transfusions, a normal bone marrow biopsy with erythroid hypoplasia, and a pathogenic variant identified in RPL11 consistent with this condition. Additional tests, including normal hemoglobin electrophoresis and elevated erythropoietin levels, further supported the diagnosis."
