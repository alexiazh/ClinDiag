        "final_diagnosis": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including difficulty breathing, generalized weakness, a history of toe-walking starting at age five, and physical examination findings such as a waddling gait, muscle hypotonia, and positive grower's sign. Additionally, elevated CK levels and electromyography findings indicating a myopathic pattern, along with muscle biopsy results showing extensive loss of skeletal muscle fibers replaced by fat tissue, further confirmed the diagnosis."
