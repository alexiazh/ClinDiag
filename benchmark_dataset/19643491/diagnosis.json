        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the identification of 17 patients with concurrent functional visual loss (FVL) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Key evidence included the presence of nonphysiologic visual field constriction, documented patterns of FVL, and nerve/field mismatch with no atrophic disc changes, suggestive of functional rather than organic visual loss."
