        "differential_diagnosis": "Surgical neuropraxia, facial nerve division due to lifting or liposuction procedures",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with complete paralysis of the left mandibular branch of the facial nerve after abdominal liposuction with normal neurologic evaluation and MRI scan. A history of a tick bite and weakly positive Lyme disease tests suggested neuroborreliosis as the cause of the palsy, which resolved after treatment with ceftriaxone."
