        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The study involved 293 unrelated patients diagnosed with HCM based on clinical criteria of left ventricular wall thickness. The presence of benign mutations in the genes related to HCM was assessed, revealing that all 5 patients with benign mutations exhibited clinically severe expression of HCM, requiring surgical myectomy or heart transplant, challenging the previously held notion of benign mutations."
