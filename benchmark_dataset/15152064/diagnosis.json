        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited symptoms of slowly progressive numbness, paresthesias, and pain, particularly affecting small-fiber sensory neuropathy. Diagnostic tests ruled out diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, and other possible causes. Electrophysiological studies showed normal results indicative of small-fiber involvement, bolstered by skin biopsies revealing reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density. The findings suggest that the patient's condition is consistent with idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy."
