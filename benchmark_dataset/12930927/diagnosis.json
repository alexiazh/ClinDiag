        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The proband had multiple pregnancies complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), characterized by abdominal pain, nausea, and ultrasonographic findings of enlarged, multilocular ovaries with ascites. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor leading to hypersensitivity to chorionic gonadotropin, which was linked to the recurrent episodes of OHSS."
