        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by functional and structural analysis of novel mutations in the CYP11B1 gene, which resulted in decreased 11-hydroxylase activity, confirmed by in vitro studies showing residual enzymatic activity below critical thresholds for typical CAH phenotypes."
