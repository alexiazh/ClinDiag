        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a large solitary skin nodule that was indurated and erythematous. Histopathological examination revealed atypical lymphoid cells with T-cell markers present in the skin, along with serologic confirmation of antibodies to HTLV-1 and Southern blot analysis showing clonal integration of HTLV-1 proviral DNA in the skin. No evidence of leukemic or lymph nodal involvement was observed, leading to the classification as smoldering type of ATLL."
