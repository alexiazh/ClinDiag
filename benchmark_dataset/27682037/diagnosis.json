        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient has a known history of bipolar disorder, which contributed to her nonadherence to treatment for newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer. Her symptoms of depression, which included low motivation and hopelessness, were consistent with a major depressive episode typical of bipolar disorder. The presence of an invasive ductal carcinoma was confirmed through imaging and biopsy, distinguishing it from potential metastases originating from her lung cancer."
