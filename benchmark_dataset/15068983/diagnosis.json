        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of West Nile virus encephalitis was confirmed through a positive PCR result for West Nile virus in cerebrospinal fluid on day 10 of illness, following a clinical presentation that included fever, neurological deficits, and ultimately status epilepticus. Despite initial normal MRI scans, progressive MRI changes in deep gray matter structures were observed over time, aligning with characteristics of West Nile virus infection."
