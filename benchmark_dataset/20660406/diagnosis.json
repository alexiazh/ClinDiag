        "differential_diagnosis": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Alzheimer's disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with seizures and MRI findings indicated extensive vasogenic edema and multiple cerebral microbleeds. The clinical presentation and neuroimaging features were strongly suggestive of inflammatory-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy, especially in the context of the patient’s cognitive decline and previous vascular changes. Other conditions like Alzheimer’s disease were considered based on the history of cognitive impairment, but the significant new acute changes led to the final diagnosis."
