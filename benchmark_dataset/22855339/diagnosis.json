    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Selective 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency due to CYP2R1 mutations",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by molecular genetic analysis of the CYP2R1 gene, which revealed two previously undescribed mutations indicative of an autosomal recessive disorder. The clinical and biochemical features included classical vitamin D deficiency symptoms and laboratory results showing low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high alkaline phosphatase levels. Improvement of symptoms and laboratory results with vitamin D therapy suggested dysfunction in vitamin D metabolism due to CYP2R1 mutations."
