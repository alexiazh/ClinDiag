        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Hinman syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of nausea, bilateral flank pain, urinary retention, history of recurrent urinary tract infections, and extensive diagnostic imaging results including severe bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, irregular bladder contour, and progression of vesicoureteral reflux. The patient's psychological profile was also relevant, as psychological conditions are often associated with this syndrome."
