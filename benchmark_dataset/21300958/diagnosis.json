        "final_diagnosis": "Reverse Lutembacher Syndrome associated with bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with dyspnea and oxygen desaturation worsened in the upright position, consistent with platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. Significant tricuspid valve stenosis was confirmed through echocardiography and right heart catheterization, with an observed right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Imaging indicated severe thickening of the bioprosthetic valve leaflets and reduction in valve orifice area, supporting the diagnosis of reverse Lutembacher syndrome. The patient's history of endocarditis and stroke related to paradoxical embolism further reinforced the diagnosis."
