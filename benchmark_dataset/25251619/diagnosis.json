        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and laboratory findings suggesting liver dysfunction, including elevated aminotransferase levels and splenomegaly. Various potential causes of liver disease were considered, including autoimmune hepatitis and Wilson's disease. A scoring system indicated autoimmune hepatitis as probable, but subsequent findings suggested Wilson's disease was more likely due to significant copper deposition in liver biopsy and a quantitative tissue copper level consistent with Wilson's disease."
