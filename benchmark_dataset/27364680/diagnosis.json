        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of primary syphilis was supported by the presence of a non-tender, indurated ulcer on the tongue, positive syphilis serology including a positive Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay and rapid plasma reagin test, and confirmation of Treponema pallidum via PCR from the lesions. Histological examination of biopsied lesions also supported the diagnosis."
