        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis was supported by the patient's symptoms of bilateral ear pain, swelling, erythema, and the presence of a dense perichondrial inflammatory infiltrate observed in biopsy. Additionally, the positive type 2 collagen antibody test and the clinical response to treatment further reinforced this diagnosis."
