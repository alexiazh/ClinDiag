            "relevant_findings": "At 7 days of age, the first ultrasound scan showed well-differentiated kidneys with normal echogenicity. At 3 months, nephrocalcinosis was detected on serial ultrasound scans. At 9 months, ultrasound revealed two hyperechogenic images (6 and 5 mm) at the left lower renal pole, and a stone of about 6 mm in the right ureter with modest dilation of the upstream ureter (5 mm). At 12 and 20 months, ultrasound showed improvement in nephrocalcinosis and persistence of the two left kidney stones, unchanged from the previous examination.",
            "changes_over_time": "Nephrocalcinosis was first noted at 3 months. By 9 months, kidney stones were observed alongside nephrocalcinosis. Improvement in nephrocalcinosis was noted at 12 and 20 months, while the condition of the two left kidney stones remained unchanged."
