        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of latex allergy was based on the patient's clinical history of bronchospasm after exposure to latex, positive skin prick tests with latex, elevated specific IgE against latex, and a documented history of urticaria following previous latex exposure. The immediate respiratory and cardiovascular reactions after disinfectant exposure further supported the diagnosis."
