        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Micro syndrome was supported by the clinical presentation of nystagmus, congenital cataracts, microcephaly, and developmental delay, along with MRI findings of corpus callosum hypoplasia and genetic testing revealing pathogenic variants in RAB3GAP1. The patient's symptoms and genetic findings were consistent with the diagnostic criteria for Micro syndrome."
