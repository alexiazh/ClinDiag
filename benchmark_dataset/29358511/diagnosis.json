        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of brachial plexopathy, alongside the family history of similar episodes and the identification of a mutation in the Septin 9 gene, supported the diagnosis of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. The absence of trauma, cancer, or radiation exposure, and normal laboratory results further directed the reasoning towards HNA."
