        "final_diagnosis": "cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the penis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by histologic analysis revealing changes consistent with squamous cell carcinoma and the patient's rapid onset of an erythematous, violaceous, indurated papule on the penis, which raised concern. Additionally, negative human papillomavirus testing and a full-body CT scan showing no evidence of metastatic disease contributed to the diagnosis."
