        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Cardiomyopathy was diagnosed based on cardiovascular MRI findings, showing slightly reduced left ventricular systolic function, regional hypokinesia in the inferolateral wall, and late gadolinium enhancement indicative of myocardial damage. This pattern was consistent between the DMD patient and his DMD carrier mother, suggesting a genetic predisposition to cardiomyopathy."
