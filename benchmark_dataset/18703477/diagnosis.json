        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease was supported by the presence of a mass in the infundibular area, alongside lesions in the cerebellum, and the unique radiographic finding of circumferential soft tissue encasement of the aorta. The histopathology showed foamy histiocytes and fibrosis without granulomas, aligning with Erdheim-Chester disease characteristics."
