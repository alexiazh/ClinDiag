        "final_diagnosis": "Granulomatous meningoencephalitis caused by Acanthamoeba species",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Neurosarcoidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient is a 62-year-old immunocompromised man experiencing rapidly progressive meningoencephalitis and uncontrollable cerebral edema. Although broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral therapies did not improve his condition, he had a history of sarcoidosis, and evidence of amebas was found at autopsy. The rapid progression of symptoms suggested an aggressive infection, particularly due to a protozoan. The definitive diagnosis was supported by the presence of Acanthamoeba in the brain at autopsy, leading to the conclusion of granulomatous meningoencephalitis."
