        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with rapidly progressive dementia, which escalated after a seizure. Imaging findings revealed asymmetric white-matter hyperintensity consistent with leukoencephalopathy. The patient's history of substance abuse and occupational exposure to solvents prompted consideration of toxic leukoencephalopathy. However, genetic testing and MRI findings ultimately led to the diagnosis of X-ALD, supported by elevated levels of very-long-chain fatty acids in plasma and characteristic imaging findings."
