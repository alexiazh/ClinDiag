            "findings": "Light microscopy revealed 19 glomeruli, of which 5 exhibited global glomerulosclerosis, and 1 was a crescentic glomerulus. Approximately two-thirds of the glomeruli had mesangial proliferation and subendothelial deposits. In the interstitium, lymphocytic aggregation was found around the sclerotic glomeruli, and fibrosis was observed in approximately 40% of the interstitium. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed diffuse, global and granular staining of the glomerular tuft mesangial region with IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q and C3. Electron microscopy revealed electron-deposits in the mesangial region.",
