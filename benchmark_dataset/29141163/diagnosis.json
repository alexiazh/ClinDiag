        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of progressive hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and weakness, along with the presence of hyperreflexia and bladder incontinence, indicated primary spinal cord dysfunction or myelopathy. Electrophysiological tests revealed normal sensory responses but marked attenuation in motor response amplitudes, suggesting a central cause of the motor dysfunction. A history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass raised concerns for nutritional deficiencies, leading to the suspicion of copper deficiency after noting elevated zinc levels from denture cream. Ultimately, a confirmed low blood copper level established the diagnosis of copper deficiency myelopathy."
