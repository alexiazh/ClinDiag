        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the observed medial deviation of the first toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint, the hypoplastic formation of the medial first toe seen on radiographs, and the presence of a wider interdigital space between the first and second toes. Surgical intervention was appropriate due to the characteristics of the deformity, which justified the Z-plasty procedure."
