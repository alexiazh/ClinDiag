        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of endocardial fibroelastosis was supported by clinical signs such as tachypnea, heart murmur, and poor general status, coupled with diagnostic imaging findings including echocardiographic evidence of left heart enlargement and thickening of the left ventricular posterior wall. Elevated biomarkers of heart failure and abnormalities in ECG further corroborated the heart dysfunction."
