    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "unilateral occlusion of internal carotid artery, ipsilaterally complicated by ischemic optic neuropathy and cerebral infarction",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Inherited or acquired clotting abnormalities, associated with unbalanced hemostatic condition",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by magnetic resonance imaging showing a large infarcted area in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery and magnetic resonance angiography revealing complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Laboratory tests indicated elevated homocysteine levels following a methionine load and identified hyperhomocysteinemic gene variants, which contributed to the thromboembolic events."
