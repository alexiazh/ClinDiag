        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Langerhans cell sarcoma was based on postoperative pathological results showing epithelioid and spindle-shaped tumor cells with specific immunohistochemical markers. Key evidence included the clear boundary of the tumor, significant enhancement on CT, and the absence of muscular bladder tissue invasion, which led to a staging of T1N0M0, indicating a high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC)."
