        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established through the combination of the patient's clinical presentation (worsening fatigue, weight loss, uveitis, and adrenal nodules), laboratory findings (pancytopenia, low sodium levels), imaging studies (CT showing adrenal enlargement), and ultimately, the culture from an adrenal biopsy that confirmed infection with H. capsulatum. The patient's history of immunosuppressive treatment, travel to an endemic area, and clinical symptoms indicative of disseminated infection contributed to the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis leading to adrenal insufficiency."
