        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The evaluation of the 3-year-old boy revealed a paternal family history of autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I, alongside symptoms indicative of Gaucher disease type 3. Genetic analyses indicated homozygosity for mutations in both GBA (Gaucher disease) and MPZ (Charcot-Marie-Tooth) genes, confirming the diagnosis of concurrent disorders via complete paternal isodisomy."
