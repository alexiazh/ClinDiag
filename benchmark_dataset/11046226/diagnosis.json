        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred in conjunction with elevated serum potassium levels (6.8 mM) after the administration of hypertonic mannitol, which is known to cause hyperkalemia. Electrocardiographic changes characteristic of hyperkalemia preceded the VT episode, and VT did not recur when potassium levels decreased. No other causes of VT, such as ischemic heart disease or drug effects, were identified."
