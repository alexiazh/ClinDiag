        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Balamuthia amoebic encephalitis was confirmed through immunostaining that identified Balamuthia amoebas in brain and skin tissue obtained from both patients. The presence of ring-enhancing brain lesions and an acute inflammatory response in the biopsy specimens, along with unresponsive conventional treatments for tuberculosis and HSV, led to the eventual identification of Balamuthia as the causative agent."
