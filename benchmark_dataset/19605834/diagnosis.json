        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The development of pulmonary and cutaneous nodules in the context of significant immunosuppression following induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia led to a suspicion of invasive fungal infection. The skin lesions with necrotic components, along with the presence of pulmonary nodules, supported the likelihood of fusarial infection, particularly considering the negative cultures and the clinical characteristics of the lesions."
