        "differential_diagnosis": "Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia, Primary Hyperparathyroidism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of autoantibodies that stimulated PTH release and caused PTH-dependent hypercalcemia. There were no identified mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene, and patients exhibited biochemical features similar to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, but the autoimmune nature distinguished it from genetic forms."
