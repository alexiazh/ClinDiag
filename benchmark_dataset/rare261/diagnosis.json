        "final_diagnosis": "Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Left heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, congenital heart diseases, connective tissue disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) was established in 2010 based on recurrent post-activity chest pain, shortness of breath, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Comprehensive tests in 2010 ruled out other conditions such as left heart disease and pulmonary thromboembolism. The persistence of these symptoms and a significant rise in pulmonary artery pressure, along with the subsequent right heart catheterization confirming elevated PAP, further supported the diagnosis of IPAH, especially as the patient progressed to more severe functional classes over time."
