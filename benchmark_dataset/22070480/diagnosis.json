        "final_diagnosis": "Limbic encephalitis with antibodies to leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Neoplastic diseases, Autoimmune diseases",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's episodic symptoms (olfactory hallucinations, speech arrest, posturing) and progressive memory decline led to a suspicion of limbic encephalitis. Imaging showed mild expansion and abnormal T2-weighted hyperintensity in the left medial temporal lobe. The CSF analysis indicated moderate inflammatory changes with lymphocytic predominance, without evidence of infection or malignancy. Tests for various antibodies indicated the presence of antibodies related to LGI1, correlating with his clinical presentation, and confirmed the diagnosis of limbic encephalitis."
