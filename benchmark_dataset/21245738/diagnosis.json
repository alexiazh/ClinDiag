        "final_diagnosis": "Intrathecal granulomatous mass",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of an intrathecal granulomatous mass was confirmed through MRI imaging, which revealed a flame-shaped pooling of contrast at the tip of the catheter. The patient presented with a suspected malfunction of her intrathecal drug delivery system, characterized by lack of cerebral spinal fluid back-flow and discrepancies between expected and aspirated residual volumes. Additional inspection noted that the patient had been self-administering medications, raising further concern about the integrity of the treatment system and contributing factors to the granulomatous inflammation."
