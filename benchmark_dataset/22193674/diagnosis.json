        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had severe and refractory OCD symptoms characterized by contamination obsessions and washing compulsions, and past inadequate trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The decision to perform deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the nucleus accumbens was based on the patient's failure to respond to previous treatments, and significant therapeutic benefits were noted post-DBS."
