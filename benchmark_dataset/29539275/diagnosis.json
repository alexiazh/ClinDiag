    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to pheochromocytoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Ischemia, myocardial toxicity, mechanical stress, treated myocarditis, acute myocarditis, coronary vasospasm, cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction, thrombosis with endogenous fibrinolysis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with pulmonary edema, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and apical ballooning, with no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was considered more likely than acute myocarditis due to the absence of features typically seen with myocarditis and the context of extreme labile blood pressure and palpitations, which indicate possible pheochromocytoma as an underlying cause. Imaging studies indicated the presence of an adrenal mass consistent with pheochromocytoma."
