        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was supported by the presence of specific SLC26A4 mutations (c.279delT and c.416â€“1G 3A) in affected individuals, clinical findings of deafness and goiter, and abnormal thyroid function tests indicating hypothyroxinemia alongside normal TSH levels. The mutations were further linked to findings of high deiodinase activities in the thyroid gland and impaired iodide efflux, leading to intracellular iodide accumulation."
