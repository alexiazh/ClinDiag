        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of trapezius palsy was based on the patient's presentation of scapular winging and flaccidity of the trapezius observed during physical examination, along with evidence of spinal accessory nerve injury confirmed by electromyography and nerve conduction studies. The concurrent rotator cuff-tear arthropathy was noted as a significant underlying condition that exacerbated the patientâ€™s shoulder pain and weakness."
