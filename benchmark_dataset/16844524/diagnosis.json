        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Griscelli syndrome was based on clinical and laboratory findings including silvery gray hair, light-colored skin, recurrent infections, hepatosplenomegaly, and episodes of pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Additionally, the characteristic large aggregates of pigment granules seen in hair microscopy supported the diagnosis."
