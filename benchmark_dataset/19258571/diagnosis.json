        "final_diagnosis": "Poorly Controlled Hypertension",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr R has a long history of poorly controlled hypertension despite attempts to adhere to treatment. His blood pressure has been as high as 240/180 mm Hg and has led to episodes of complications such as hypertensive emergency. Recent examinations showed blood pressure readings of 146/74 mm Hg and 144/72 mm Hg, with electrocardiogram findings indicating left ventricular hypertrophy. There are significant barriers to blood pressure control related to his individual circumstances, beliefs, and treatments, as evidenced by his inconsistent adherence to medications and the adverse effects he experienced with various treatments."
