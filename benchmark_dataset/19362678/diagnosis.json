        "final_diagnosis": "Primary hypogonadism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Klinefelter syndrome, venous thrombosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms including reduced libido, bilateral gynaecomastia, and testicular atrophy. High luteinizing hormone and follicular stimulating hormone levels, alongside low serum testosterone, confirmed primary hypogonadism. Testicular ultrasonography indicated small, heterogeneous testes with absent flow in testicular veins, consistent with bilateral venous thromboses, likely due to subtherapeutic anticoagulation for thrombophilia."
