        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy, which showed atrophic epidermis and lobular necrosis with atypical lymphocytic infiltrate that expressed markers consistent with T-cell lymphoma (positive for CD3, CD8, and CD5). The clinical presentation included tender violaceous lesions, fever, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss, which aligned with the described lymphoma."
