        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by findings of a pathologic compression fracture of T9, presence of a suprahilar mass with mediastinal invasion observed on imaging, and cytologic examination revealing nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer, indicating a neoplastic process. Immunohistochemical tests were positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 and cytokeratin CK7, supporting the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin."
