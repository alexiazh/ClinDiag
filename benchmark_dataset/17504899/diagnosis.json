        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A 637-kb interstitial duplication was identified at Xp21.2 containing the DAX1 gene, which is suggested to be dosage sensitive and responsible for gonadal dysgenesis. Genetic testing ruled out mutations in known candidate genes, confirming the role of DAX1 duplication in this case."
