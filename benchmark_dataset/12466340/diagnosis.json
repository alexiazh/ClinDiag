    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Aromatase Deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital aromatase deficiency was supported by the identification of a novel mutation in the CYP19 gene leading to loss of aromatase activity. Clinical findings included elevated levels of testosterone and androstenedione, diminished levels of estradiol and estrone, and open epiphyses indicative of delayed skeletal maturation. The patient's response to estrogen replacement therapy was consistent with the expected outcomes for aromatase deficiency, including normalization of estrogen levels and progression of bone maturation."
