        "final_diagnosis": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) associated with multiple cutaneous neuromas and macular amyloidosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "MEN 2B syndrome, MEN 2A syndrome, sporadic MTC",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with multiple cutaneous neuromas, indicating a possible hereditary syndrome. Genetic analysis revealed a mutation in the RET proto-oncogene, supporting a diagnosis of MEN 2B despite the absence of mucosal neuromas. Histopathological examinations confirmed the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The coexistence of macular amyloidosis suggested potential links to MEN syndromes, supporting the association."
