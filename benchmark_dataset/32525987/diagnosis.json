        "diagnostic_reasoning": "In the second case, the patient's normal HbA1c levels were inconsistent with his OGTT results which demonstrated 1-hour glucose of 241 mg/dl and 2-hour glucose of 204 mg/dl, supporting the diagnosis of T2D. Additionally, the patient's medical history of HIV and treatment indicated potential insulin resistance contributing to the T2D diagnosis."
