        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of isolated splenic vein thrombosis (ISVT) was supported by the presence of unenhanced lesions in the splenic vein observed on CECT scans, elevated D-dimer levels at initial admission, and subsequent imaging showing a fibrotic cord formation in the splenic vein. The patient's improvement in abdominal pain and the decreased thrombus extension upon follow-up imaging further supported the diagnosis."
