        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fatigue and generalized weakness, alongside echocardiographic findings of mild bilateral peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses and a small patent ductus arteriosus. Positive serological testing for rubella IgG antibodies indicated past exposure to the rubella virus, consistent with CRS. Additionally, the absence of typical atherosclerosis and risk factors, along with the vascular lesions suggesting congenital origin, supported the diagnosis. The patient's progressive fatigue was attributed to transaminitis and antihypertensive medications."
