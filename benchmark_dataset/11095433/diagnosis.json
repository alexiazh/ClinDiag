        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by genetic sequencing of the CYP11B1 gene, which revealed two novel mutations contributing to the patient's condition. Clinical findings included severe hypertension, pronounced ventricular hypertrophy, and mRNA analysis which indicated a significant loss of 11β-hydroxylase activity due to splicing mutations affecting enzyme functionality."
