    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Anorexia nervosa, with fecal impaction, bradycardia, delayed bone maturation, short stature, low bone density, and cerebral atrophy.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, endocrinopathies, drug abuse, pregnancy, celiac disease, depression.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of anorexia nervosa, acute abdominal pain, and imaging studies indicating fecal impaction led to the diagnosis. Other potential causes, such as superior mesenteric artery syndrome and bowel perforation, were ruled out through radiologic studies."
