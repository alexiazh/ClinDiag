        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a constellation of symptoms including dyspnea, wheezing, headaches, cough, night sweats, and eosinophilia. The elevated eosinophil count and the evidence of lung involvement, in conjunction with positive myeloperoxidase ANCA, supported the diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Other potential diagnoses were ruled out based on laboratory results, imaging findings, and negative temporal-artery biopsies."
