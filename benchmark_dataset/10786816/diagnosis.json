        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on cytologic findings showing atypical cells with a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and the presence of tumor emboli in the lymphovascular spaces. Histologic examination revealed bilateral tumors with simple and complex annular tubules characteristic of SCTAT. The malignant behavior was evidenced by lymph node metastasis and peritoneal washings containing tumor cells."
