        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with bilateral anophthalmia, congenital hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and severe bilateral cleft lip and palate, with a homozygous truncating mutation in the RAX gene. The severity of the phenotype was noted to be greater than that seen in previously reported cases with milder mutations, suggesting that the truncating RAX mutations could fully account for the observed phenotype."
