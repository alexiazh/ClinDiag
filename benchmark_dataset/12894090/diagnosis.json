        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated glucagon levels (744 pg/mL, increasing to 2570 pg/mL) and the presence of a 5-cm mass in the tail of the pancreas discovered through CT scan. Histopathological findings were consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema, particularly noting necrotic keratinocytes in the skin biopsy, which are typically absent in psoriasis."
