        "differential_diagnosis": "Coronary artery spasm, musculoskeletal conditions",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited typical chest pain and associated ECG changes indicative of myocardial ischemia despite normal coronary arteriograms. Key findings included transient ST-segment depression, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and reduced brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Other potential causes for the symptoms, including coronary artery spasm and musculoskeletal conditions, were ruled out."
