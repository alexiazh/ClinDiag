        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on a positive result from real-time PCR detecting Legionella species, which was subsequently confirmed by culture. The patient's symptoms, including fever and respiratory issues, along with laboratory findings such as leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes, supported the diagnosis of pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin led to a favorable response."
