        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of HRD syndrome was confirmed through genetic testing which identified a homozygous mutation in the TBCE gene (c.155-166del12). Key clinical and MRI findings included severe hypoplasia of the anterior pituitary and corpus callosum, GH insufficiency, and low serum IGF-I concentrations, all supporting the diagnosis."
