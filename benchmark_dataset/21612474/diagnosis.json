        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the pathological findings from the radical prostatectomy and the elevated PSA level 18 months post-surgery. The Gleason score of 8 indicated aggressive disease, and the assessment showed no evidence of local or distant metastasis at that time, despite the elevated PSA."
