        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ALPS was based on chronic accumulation of nonmalignant lymphoid cells, an increase in double-negative α/β+ T cells in the blood, and defective Fas-mediated apoptosis. The development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the patient was attributed to mutations in the Fas and perforin (Prf1) genes, indicating a link between these genetic defects and the malignancy."
