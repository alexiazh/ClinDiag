        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A 61-year-old man presented with exertional dyspnea and an irregular heart rhythm of 130 bpm, confirmed by ECG as atrial fibrillation. Physical examination suggested congestive heart failure, supported by elevated jugular venous pressure and mild pitting edema. Laboratory tests revealed mild thrombocytopenia but normal renal function. Echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular dysfunction, indicating tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Successful restoration of sinus rhythm after cardioversion led to recovery of systolic function, confirming the diagnosis."
