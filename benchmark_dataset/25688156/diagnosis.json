        "differential_diagnosis": "L5 radiculopathy; fibular neuropathy; other mononeuropathies",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited foot drop and weakness in ankle dorsiflexion with preserved ankle inversion, suggesting fibular neuropathy as the underlying cause. Neurophysiological examination indicated conduction block of the fibular nerve, and MRI revealed a cystic mass at the fibular neck consistent with an intraneural ganglion cyst, confirmed upon surgical decompression."
