        "final_diagnosis": "severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to CD3 delta deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of SCID was supported by the absence of T cells and the presence of normal B cells in the patients, alongside significant immunodeficiency and a specific homozygous mutation in the CD3 delta gene, preventing the synthesis of the CD3 delta protein. Flow cytometry revealed virtually no mature T cells, with thymus analysis suggesting an arrest in T cell development at an early stage."
