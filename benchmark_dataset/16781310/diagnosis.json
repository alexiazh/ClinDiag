        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pemphigoid nodularis was supported by skin biopsy results, direct immunofluorescence showing linear deposition of C3 and IgG at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the 180 kD bullous pemphigoid antigen. The patient had a history of bullous pemphigoid and extensive prurigo nodularis-like lesions that were resistant to multiple treatments."
