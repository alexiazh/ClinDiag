        "final_diagnosis": "Fetal valproate syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Fetal valproate syndrome was supported by the mother's use of valproic acid during pregnancy, the physical examination findings consistent with the syndrome including capillary hemangioma, craniofacial dysmorphism, limb abnormalities, and cardiac anomalies. Additionally, imaging studies and genetic tests ruled out other possible syndromes like Holt-Oram syndrome and Fanconi anaemia, further supporting the diagnosis."
