        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PSIS was established based on the triad of findings: a very thin/interrupted pituitary stalk, an ectopic posterior pituitary gland, and hypoplasia or aplasia of the anterior pituitary gland, supported by brain imaging and the presence of combined pituitary hormone deficiencies. Genetic analysis identified heterozygous missense mutations in PROKR2 and WDR11, implicating a digenic mechanism as the cause of this condition."
