        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. A was admitted with severe depressive symptoms including dysphoria, ruminative worries, insomnia, suicidal ideation, and delusions, which supported the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. Her suicidal impulses and impulsive attempt to induce miscarriage indicated the severity of her condition. The restoration of her decision-making capacity through treatment led to her change in preference regarding the pregnancy."
