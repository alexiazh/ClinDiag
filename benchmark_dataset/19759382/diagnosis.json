        "differential_diagnosis": "Pulmonary infection, esophageal candidiasis, lymphoma (advanced HIV-related), depression, chronic obstructive lung disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms typical of advanced HIV infection such as thrush and esophageal candidiasis, alongside systemic signs like weight loss, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and pneumonia. The positive HIV test and low CD4+ T-cell count confirmed the advanced HIV diagnosis. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was supported by imaging showing liver lesions and a biopsy showing diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, occurring in a context of HIV infection."
