        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of grade 3 transitional-cell carcinoma, and imaging revealed progressive pulmonary infiltrates. Bronchoscopy showed atypical epithelial cells and a few acid-fast bacilli. Liver biopsy confirmed metastatic transitional-cell carcinoma. The absence of organisms in cultures suggested a rapidly evolving infection, likely Nocardia asteroides, complicating the metastatic disease."
