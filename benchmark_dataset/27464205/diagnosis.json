    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Somnolence due to the cerebral fat embolism syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Sepsis, central nervous system infections (bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, medication effects (opioid overdose, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome), embolic central nervous system event.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's rapid progression to somnolence, fever, tachycardia, and neurological signs after proximal femoral surgery suggested a surgical complication. Despite the absence of classic fat embolism findings such as hypoxemia and rash, the timeline and the patient's context (tumor, fracture, and surgery) strongly indicated fat embolism syndrome. MRI findings confirmed ischemic changes consistent with cerebral fat embolism."
