        "final_diagnosis": "PAPSS2 deficiency leading to androgen excess",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Polycystic ovary syndrome, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Autonomous steroid production by an adrenal or gonadal tumor",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of very low DHEAS levels combined with increased DHEA and active androgen levels indicated an impairment in DHEA sulfation due to genetic mutations in PAPSS2. Dexamethasone suppression confirmed that adrenal or gonadal tumors were not responsible for the hormone levels, ruling out autonomous steroid production and congenital adrenal hyperplasia as differential diagnoses. Furthermore, the accumulation of androgens and the absence of DHEAS pointed towards PAPSS2 deficiency as the underlying cause."
