        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis was supported by the infant's clinical presentation of poor feeding, emesis, and abdominal distention, alongside the findings from the abdominal x-ray indicating early pneumatosis in the bowel. Additionally, the infant's weight loss and previous NICU stay due to hypoglycemia provided context for the risk factors associated with this condition."
