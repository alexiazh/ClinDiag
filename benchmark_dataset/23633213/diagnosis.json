        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by abnormal thyroid function tests indicating low free T4, high T3, and normal TSH levels along with clinical features such as growth retardation, delayed bone development, and constipation. The assessment of treatment effects with LT4 showed normalization of certain thyroid parameters, further corroborating the diagnosis."
