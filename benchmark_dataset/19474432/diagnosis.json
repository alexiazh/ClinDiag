        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's progressive neurologic deficits, combined with a history of skin lesions, arthralgias, and oral/genital ulcers, suggested a systemic issue. Neuroimaging showed changes consistent with inflammation and edema, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed neutrophilic pleocytosis. The exclusion of various infectious, demyelinating, and inflammatory conditions led to the conclusion of neuro-Behçet’s disease."
