        "differential_diagnosis": "Brain abscess, Chronic liver disease, Hepatitis C",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient diagnosed with HPS showed significant hypoxemia linked to liver cirrhosis, supported by the presence of a massive intrapulmonary shunt. Additional evidence included the low oxygen saturation levels despite supplemental oxygen, and imaging studies confirmed a pulmonary shunt. Brain abscess was identified as a complication of the patientâ€™s systemic issues."
