        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with renal impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. Renal biopsy revealed extensive amyloid involvement, and genetic analysis detected a heterozygous mutation p.Leu102Ser in the lysozyme gene. The pattern of symptoms and the presence of amyloid confirmed the diagnosis of hereditary lysozyme amyloidosis."
