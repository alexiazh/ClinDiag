    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) due to homozygous CaSR Q459R mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Adolescent rickets with secondary hyperparathyroidism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 16-year-old girl, had clinical features of rickets and secondary hyperparathyroidism, alongside vitamin D deficiency and a homozygous CaSR Q459R mutation. Vitamin D treatment led to elevated serum calcium and changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, suggesting an FHH-like phenotype due to the mutation, despite the initial presentation being primarily rickets."
