        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury was based on the timing of ALT and AST elevations after the initiation of remdesivir, the positive response following the discontinuation of the drug, and the absence of alternative causes for the hepatotoxicity, including an unlikely role of COVID-19 given its onset timeline."
