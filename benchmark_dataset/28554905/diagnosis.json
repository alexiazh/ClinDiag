        "final_diagnosis": "Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and peripheral neuropathy from uncontrolled diabetes mellitus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, medication toxicity, alcohol intoxication, mercury intoxication, post-infectious viral cerebellitis, malignancy (paraneoplastic syndrome), vitamin deficiencies",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The MRI revealed symmetric signal abnormalities in the pons and cerebellum, which are characteristic of ODS. The patient's history of uncontrolled diabetes, symptoms of acute-onset ataxia and dysarthria, and negative tests for alternate causes supported the diagnosis. The severity of sensory impairment did not account for the ataxia, indicating a cerebellar component likely due to ODS from hyperosmolar state caused by diabetes."
