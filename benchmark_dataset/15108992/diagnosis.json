        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility was confirmed based on elevated resting creatine kinase levels, rapid exhaustion after exercise, and a positive response in the in vitro halothane/caffeine muscle test. Genetic screening revealed specific mutations in the RYR1 gene associated with MH susceptibility."
