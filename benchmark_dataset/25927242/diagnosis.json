        "final_diagnosis": "46,XY Gonadal Dysgenesis due to Homozygous Mutation in Desert Hedgehog (DHH)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of gonadal dysgenesis was supported by the identification of a novel homozygous R124Q mutation in the desert hedgehog gene (DHH), which alters a conserved residue and has been implicated in the gonadal development process. Histological evaluations of the gonads revealed seminoma and atypical cells consistent with gonadal dysgenesis. Both patients exhibited significant clinical features, including primary amenorrhea, lack of uterine development, and symptoms of polyneuropathy."
