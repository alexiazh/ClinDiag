        "final_diagnosis": "Atrial fibrillation due to acute emotional stress",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Interrogation of the patient's implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) showed that supraventricular tachycardia developed shortly after an episode of emotional stress when the patient's wife yelled at him. This tachycardia degenerated into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response that the ICD interpreted as ventricular arrhythmia, leading to an inappropriate shock delivery. Electrophysiology testing confirmed the presence of atrial flutter, which was easily induced and subsequently ablated."
