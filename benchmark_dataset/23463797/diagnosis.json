        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of HIV infection was made after a patient presented with significant symptoms including paresthesias, inguinal swelling, extreme fatigue, and opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis (indicated by acid-fast bacilli in lymph node biopsy) and filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti) confirmed through serologies. This was compounded by a very low CD4 count of 84 cells/mm3, supporting the diagnosis of advanced HIV."
