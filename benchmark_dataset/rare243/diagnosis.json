        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Hurler-Scheie syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including macrocephaly, corneal clouding, and characteristic skeletal abnormalities seen in radiographs, such as bullet-shaped phalanges and acetabular dysplasia. Symptoms indicative of lysosomal storage disease, along with past medical history of hydrocephalus and recurrent seizures, further informed the diagnosis."
