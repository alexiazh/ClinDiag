        "diagnostic_reasoning": "FDG-PET imaging was performed to evaluate possible cancer in patients with proved benign fractures. It was noted that FDG uptake can occur in these fractures, potentially leading to false-positive results when assessing for skeletal metastases. Clinical correlation and the pattern of uptake helped differentiate fractures from metastatic lesions."
