        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through the identification of a novel insertion mutation in the ARH gene of the affected siblings, resulting in a frame shift and an early stop codon. Clinical features included severe hypercholesterolemia, cutaneous and tendinous xanthomas, and fatty liver, which were present despite normal LDL receptor activity in their fibroblasts."
