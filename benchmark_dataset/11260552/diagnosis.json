        "differential_diagnosis": "Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acquired aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma was made based on the characteristic clinical presentation of burning and edema affecting the palms after brief immersion in water, confirmed by the 'hand-in-the-bucket' sign observed in all patients. The symptoms resolved within an hour after removal from water, and the condition was effectively treated with aluminum chloride hexahydrate, leading to significant improvement."
