        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's recurrent hematemesis and hematochezia, along with the medical history of aortic graft repair, raised suspicion for an aortoenteric fistula. Although initial endoscopic and imaging studies were inconclusive, repeated episodes of bleeding necessitated further investigation, leading to the discovery of a duodenal ulcer adherent to the aortic graft during surgical exploration, confirming the diagnosis."
