        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the discovery of compound heterozygous mutations (R120X/R770X) in the SBP2 gene, which disrupted functional motifs and inhibited the binding of SBP2 to Sec insertion sequence elements. Clinical features included abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism, delayed bone maturation, congenital myopathy, and reduced levels of serum selenium and glutathione peroxidase, indicating a combined deficiency of selenoproteins."
