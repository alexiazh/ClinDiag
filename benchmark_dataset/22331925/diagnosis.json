    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Moderate to severe aortic insufficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Subclavian steal syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's neurological symptoms resolved with physical exertion, and an echocardiogram demonstrated moderate aortic regurgitation. Despite evidence of retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery, angiography ruled out subclavian stenosis. Further investigation with flow-sensitive 4D MRI revealed that aortic insufficiency and retrograde flow dynamics contributed to the neurological symptoms, correlating symptom progression with worsening aortic insufficiency."
