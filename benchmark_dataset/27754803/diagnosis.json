        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of estrogen insensitivity syndrome was strongly suggested by the clinical presentation of primary amenorrhea, delayed bone maturation, extremely high plasma 17Î²-estradiol levels, and elevated gonadotrophin levels. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous mutation of the ESR1 gene, leading to a significant impairment of ER function, confirming the diagnosis."
