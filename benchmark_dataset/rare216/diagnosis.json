        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was supported by the patient's history of recurrent EBV infections, presentation of symptoms including recurrent fever, splenomegaly, and anemia, along with mutational analysis showing mutations in UNC13D genes. Furthermore, significant findings in blood tests, such as moderate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ferritin levels, and decreased NK cell activity, along with bone marrow biopsy results indicating hemophagocytic events and hyperplasia, contributed to this diagnosis."
