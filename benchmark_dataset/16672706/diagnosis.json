        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Q fever was supported by the patient's clinical exposure to farm animals, the presence of fibrin-ring granulomas in liver and bone marrow biopsies, negative serologic tests for other potential causes, and the significant elevation of antibodies to C. burnetii, confirming the diagnosis. The patient's clinical status improved dramatically after treatment with doxycycline."
