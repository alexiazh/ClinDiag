        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of XLHED was supported by genetic testing revealing hemizygosity for the EDA mutation c.911Aâ†’G (p.Y304C) in both twins, along with significant ultrasound findings including the absence of tooth germs. Additionally, the lack of sweat pores and accompanying prenatal treatment with Fc-EDA resulted in normal sweating capability postnatally, indicating the correct condition was diagnosed."
