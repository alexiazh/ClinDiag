        "differential_diagnosis": "West Nile virus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, hepatitis A, B, and C virus infections",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was based on the clinical presentation of persistent fever, pancytopenia, elevated serum ferritin levels, and liver injury. DENV-3 was confirmed through a bone marrow biopsy, and the presence of eosinophilic macrophages with erythrophagocytosis supported the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis triggered by dengue infection."
