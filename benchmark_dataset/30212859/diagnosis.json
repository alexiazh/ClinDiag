        "differential_diagnosis": "Possible alveolar echinococcosis (AE)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Versteria sp. infection was supported by clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological evidence of extensive necrosis with granulomas and protoscolex. Cross-reactivity in serology with Echinococcus granulosus was noted, but negative results for E. multilocularis and confirming molecular tests pointed towards Versteria sp."
