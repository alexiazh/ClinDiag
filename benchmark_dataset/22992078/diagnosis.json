        "final_diagnosis": "Squamous-cell carcinoma involving the skull base",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Infectious processes (e.g., opportunistic infections, subacute bacterial endocarditis, intracranial tuberculoma)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with fever and progressive bilateral cranial-nerve palsies shortly after treatment for squamous-cell carcinoma. Despite ruling out recurrent cancer via imaging and lack of signs typical for locoregional recurrence, the cranial nerve involvement and imaging findings indicated a process involving the skull base. Opportunistic infections were considered due to the patient's immunocompromised status, leading to a recommendation for biopsy to ascertain the definitive diagnosis."
