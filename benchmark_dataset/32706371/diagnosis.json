        "final_diagnosis": "Severe COVID-19 due to loss-of-function variants in X-chromosomal TLR7",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the identification of rare loss-of-function variants in TLR7, which were associated with impaired type I and III interferon responses in young men with severe COVID-19. Whole-exome sequencing was performed, and functional tests indicated defective upregulation of type I interferon-related genes in response to stimulation, supporting the link between TLR7 variants and severe COVID-19."
