        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patients presented with sudden spells of anger resembling panic attacks but lacking affects of fear and anxiety. Treatment with antidepressants led to marked improvements, suggesting a connection to underlying mood disorders and highlighting the nature of these episodes as inappropriate anger responses. The diagnosis aligns with DSM-III-R criteria for depressive disorder not otherwise specified in one patient, while none exhibited personality disorders. The presence of autonomic arousal symptoms also suggested a potential variant of panic attacks."
