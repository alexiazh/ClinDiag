        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The boy had a history of neonatal hypotonia and severe feeding difficulties with persistent isolated facial and bulbar paresis. His mother was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis when he was 3 years old. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of negative AChR antibodies at 3 years, and the abnormal low CMAPs evoked from the facial muscles. There was no improvement with oral pyridostigmine."
