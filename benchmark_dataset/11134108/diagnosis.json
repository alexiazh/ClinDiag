        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a novel PROP1 gene mutation (13-bp deletion) in affected individuals, leading to deficiencies in GH, TSH, and other anterior pituitary hormones. The unusual finding of progressive cortisol deficiency in two subjects was noted, which is not typically associated with CPHD from PROP1 mutations."
