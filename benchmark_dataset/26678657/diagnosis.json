        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) was supported by genetic testing revealing a germline PTEN mutation (c.697C>T), positive immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A and synaptophysin, and the presence of macrophysical features consistent with Cowden Syndrome (CS). The patient's tumor did not display common alterations typically found in sporadic pancreatic NETs, suggesting a unique association with CS."
