        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Pachyonychia congenita was supported by a strong familial history and the clinical presentation of palmoplantar callouses and subungual hypertrophy. The histopathologic examination revealed the characteristic findings consistent with the condition, and a negative HPV test helped rule out other potential causes of the laryngeal lesions."
