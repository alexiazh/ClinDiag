        "final_diagnosis": "New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1â€“producing Escherichia coli infection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular testing which identified the NDM-1 gene in the isolated E. coli. The patient's prior history of travel to India, the emergence of fever, and the presence of the pan-resistant E. coli strain supported the diagnosis. Initial testing confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli from urine and sputum, but it was the later molecular testing that specifically identified NDM-1."
