        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis is supported by findings of a heterozygous insertion mutation in exon 3 of the GNAS gene leading to a frameshift and stop codon. Clinical features included brachymetacarpia, mental retardation, normocalcemic pseudohypoparathyroidism, and reduced Gs/H9251-L protein levels, which confirm the pathophysiology associated with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia."
