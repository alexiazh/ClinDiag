        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Aromatase Deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited severe aromatase deficiency characterized by persistent linear growth and infertility, confirmed by a homozygous point mutation in the P-450 aromatase gene leading to undetectable serum estradiol levels. The necessity and efficacy of transdermal estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD) were evaluated, showing significant improvements in BMD during treatment phases, confirming the role of estrogens in maintaining bone mineral content in adult men."
