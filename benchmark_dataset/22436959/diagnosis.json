        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Audiometry documented bilateral symmetric moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss, more pronounced in the higher frequencies. This pattern is typical for presbycusis, which is the most common form of age-related hearing loss. The patient acknowledged difficulties with hearing in group settings and needed higher volumes for media, corroborated by family observations of her misunderstandings in conversations."
