        "final_diagnosis": "Disseminated Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical symptoms (right hip pain, fever, rigors, night sweats, weight loss, intermittent chest pain), radiologic findings (multiple nodules in the lungs, abscesses in the spleen, lytic lesions), and the identification of Mycobacterium avium by DNA hybridization from the right iliac lesion. Immune function studies indicated a normal immune response to specific antigens, pointing to an underlying susceptibility to NTM infections due to an interferon-gamma receptor mutation."
