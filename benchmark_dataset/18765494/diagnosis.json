        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus was supported by MRI findings indicating aqueductal stenosis, presence of the classic NPH triad (cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence), and the temporal association between the onset of paranoid delusions and diagnosis of NPH. Lack of significant family or personal history of psychosis further supports the diagnosis being related to NPH."
