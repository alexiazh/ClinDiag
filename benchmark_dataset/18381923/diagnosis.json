        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of lamotrigine-induced hepatitis was supported by the close temporal relationship between the administration of lamotrigine and the elevation of transaminases, along with the normalization of liver enzymes after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Other causes such as viral hepatitis and alcohol use were excluded through serological testing and patient history."
