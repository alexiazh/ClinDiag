    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Cystic fibrosis due to compound heterozygous CFTR Phe508del and D1152H mutations.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent sinus infections, chronic cough, and bronchiectasis confirmed by chest CT. Sputum culture revealed nontuberculous mycobacteria, and sweat chloride testing suggested partial CFTR function. Genetic testing identified significant CFTR mutations, confirming cystic fibrosis as the primary diagnosis, with primary ciliary dyskinesia as the alternative."
