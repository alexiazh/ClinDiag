        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included increasing dyspnea, cough, and wheezing, along with blood eosinophilia and the characteristic findings on chest CT. The high eosinophil count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, along with the response to corticosteroids and the requirement for ongoing treatment, supported the diagnosis of Idiopathic Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia."
