    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "adenocarcinoma of the cecum with metastases to regional lymph nodes and peritoneum (AJCC stage T4N1M1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "small-bowel cancer, appendiceal cancer, metastatic carcinoma from another site (upper gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, bile duct), pseudomyxoma peritonei",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "CT and PET scans showed a mass in the cecum with intense tracer uptake and evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis and lung metastases. Pathological examination of biopsies confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma, with immunohistochemical analysis arguing against hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) due to intact nuclear staining in tumor cells."
