        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 16-year-old sexually active girl, presented with a history of irregular periods and was previously diagnosed with PCOS as the etiology of her menstrual irregularity. Previous evaluations evidenced heavy periods at irregular intervals and minimal hirsutism. Considering her medical history and symptoms, the healthcare provider concluded that the management of her PCOS warranted a different contraceptive approach."
