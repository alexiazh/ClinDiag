    "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
    "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient experienced angioedema and urticaria after exposure to Galleria mellonella larvae used as bait for fishing. Skin prick tests revealed slight positivity to common allergens, but specific IgE detection was positive for the larvae. Patch testing resulted in a positive reaction, confirming the IgE-mediated sensitization."
