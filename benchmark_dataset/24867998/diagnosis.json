        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Type A Aortic Dissection was supported by computed tomographic angiography revealing an aneurysm of the ascending aorta, focal outpouching, and high-attenuation pericardial effusion, which suggested a focal type A aortic dissection with contained rupture. Intraoperative findings of a dissection flap in the ascending aorta along with compression of pulmonary arteries further reinforced the diagnosis, while the appearance of pulmonary filling defects was attributed to external compression rather than an embolus."
