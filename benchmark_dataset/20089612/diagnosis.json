        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of adult HPP was established based on persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, elevated urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and serum pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels, along with the presence of pseudofractures in the proximal femur. Genetic testing revealed two missense mutations in the TNSALP gene associated with the disease."
