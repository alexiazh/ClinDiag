        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Leptospirosis was considered given the patient's exposure to farm work without protection, clinical presentation of systemic symptoms, and laboratory findings of inflammatory response. However, serological tests for Leptospira IgM and IgG antibodies were negative, indicating the final diagnosis may have been confirmed through clinical context and other findings despite the negative serology."
