        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis was supported by the presence of multiple dysmorphic features, developmental delay, and specific findings in diagnostic tests, including elevated urine MPS screening and genetic variants in the GUSB gene indicating a disorder in lysosomal storage. The imaging studies showed skeletal abnormalities consistent with mucopolysaccharidosis."
