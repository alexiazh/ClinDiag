    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia due to C562Y calcium-sensing receptor mutation and coexisting parathyroid adenoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through clinical, biochemical, and genetic examinations. The patient presented with severe hypercalcemia, a high S-PTH level, low urinary calcium excretion, and a C562Y mutation in the CaSR gene. The Ca/Cr ratio below 0.01 further indicated familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, despite the presence of a parathyroid adenoma."
