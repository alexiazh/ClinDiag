        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of APECED was supported by the presentation of clinical features such as recurrent infections and mucocutaneous candidiasis in one patient (AR), hypoparathyroidism in another (DR), and alopecia aerata with minor ectodermal features in a third patient (ST). Genetic analysis revealed typical and novel mutations in the AIRE gene, linking the observed clinical features to APECED. The lack of additional symptoms or conditions typical of APECED in the patients raised questions about the adequacy of current diagnostic criteria."
