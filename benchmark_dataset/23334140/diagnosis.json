        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited symptoms such as severe headache, right-sided weakness, and visual alterations along with a positive genetic study for CACNA1A mutation. The brain perfusion scan demonstrated decreased activity in the left parieto-occipital cortex consistent with the transient neurological symptoms. These findings supported the diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine."
