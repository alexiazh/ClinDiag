Initially, at 2 years of age, the patient was diagnosed with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which typically presents with hypoparathyroidism. However, this patient exhibited hypercalcemia alongside inappropriately high PTH levels. Symptoms persisted, and treatment with cinacalcet was initiated at 10 years of age, which normalized calcium levels but led to mild symptoms of hypocalcemia. Symptoms returned after discontinuation of treatment.",
