        "final_diagnosis": "Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3) due to AP2S1 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's hypercalcemia with inappropriately high PTH levels and hypocalciuria, along with the lack of CASR mutations and absence of parathyroid adenomas, led to the consideration of a genetic cause. The identification of a heterozygous missense mutation in the AP2S1 gene provided a clear rationale for concluding familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 as the diagnosis."
