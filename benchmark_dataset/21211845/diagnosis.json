        "final_diagnosis": "Fundus albipunctatus associated with compound heterozygous mutations in RPE65",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis is supported by clinical presentations of uniform, yellow-white dots in the fundus of the proband, associated with mutations identified in RPE65. Key evidence includes reduced thickness of the central retina, diminished FAF intensity, and altered ffERG responses indicative of rod and cone dysfunction. This case establishes a mutation-specific phenotypic effect relating compound heterozygous mutations in RPE65 to fundus albipunctatus."
