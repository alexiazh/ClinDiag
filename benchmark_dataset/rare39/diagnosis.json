        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Goblet cell carcinoma was supported by the initial findings of appendiceal goblet cell carcinoma after a surgical resection, along with further evidence such as the presence of increased carbohydrate antigen 125 levels, positive anti-amphiphysin antibodies in CSF and serum, and specific immunohistochemical staining results indicating neuroendocrine features and reactivity with amphiphysin-Abs. Additionally, neurological symptoms progressed after the initial treatment and were consistent with central nervous system involvement."
