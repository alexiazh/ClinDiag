        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Onychocytic Matricoma was supported by histopathologic examination of a nail matrix biopsy, which revealed acanthosis of the nail matrix with characteristic matrical onychocytes, increased melanin deposition indicated by a Fontana-Masson stain, and the absence of cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemical stains did not indicate a definitive melanocytic lesion."
