        "final_diagnosis": "multiple cardiac fibromas involving the mitral valve and left ventricular outflow tract",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of multiple cardiac fibromas, which were observed in conjunction with an altered aortic valve following prior valve endocarditis. The accumulation of mobile structures was hypothesized to relate to congenital alterations and inflammatory changes, along with aortic regurgitations contributing to tumor development."
