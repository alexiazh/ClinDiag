        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Thyroid Hormone Resistance (THR) was supported by the identification of elevated TSH levels despite high serum thyroid hormone levels in patients. Key findings included persistent elevation of TSH for given levels of serum thyroid hormones, normal imaging of the pituitary gland, and exclusion of pituitary TSH-producing tumors. The case study focused on specific mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor which correlated with altered pituitary response to thyroid hormones."
