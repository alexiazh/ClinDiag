        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with episodic, reversible neurologic deficits followed by persistent bilateral right inferior quadrantanopia. Cranial MRI revealed contrast-enhancing masses in the left occipital lobe, and there was no evidence of lesions outside the brain. The imaging characteristics and the patient's age favored a primary malignant tumor, particularly glioblastoma, over metastatic tumors and other neurologic conditions."
