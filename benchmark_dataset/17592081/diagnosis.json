        "final_diagnosis": "Congenital Long-QT Syndrome due to SCN4B-Encoded Sodium Channel Mutation (L179F)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with profound QT prolongation (QTc of 712 ms) and intermittent 2:1 AV block. Genetic testing identified a novel missense mutation (L179F) in SCN4B that was absent in 800 reference alleles and cosegregated in a 3-generation pedigree. This mutation resulted in increased late sodium current consistent with LQT3 traits, which was further supported by the ECG findings and family history of sudden cardiac deaths."
