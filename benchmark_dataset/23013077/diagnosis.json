        "final_diagnosis": "Coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction in a woman with HIV infection.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Coronary vasospasm, coronary dissection, coronary embolus, aortic dissection with coronary occlusion, pericarditis, myocarditis, stress-induced cardiomyopathy.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with classic symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia, supported by ECG findings showing ST-segment elevation and depression, which pointed towards acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease. Traditional risk factors such as dyslipidemia and a family history of heart disease, coupled with her HIV status, likely contributed to her presentation."
