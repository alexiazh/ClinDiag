        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of broad, pauciseptate hyphae in biopsies, indicating mucormycosis, alongside the clinical manifestations of sinus infection and cranial nerve involvement. The patient's diabetes mellitus was a significant factor predisposing him to fungal infection. The absence of typical findings for tuberculosis and the confirmation of fungal elements during pathological examination were critical in concluding the diagnosis."
