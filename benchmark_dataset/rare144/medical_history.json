        "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented for an ophthalmic evaluation after experiencing nystagmus since birth and bilateral high myopia. At age 2, she underwent cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL implantation. She initially had 20/200 vision in both eyes. Pain in the left eye led to an emergency department referral 16 months later, where no light perception was found in the left eye, which had spontaneous subtotal hyphaemia and elevated intraocular pressure (25mmHg) that later increased to 55mmHg despite treatment. An anterior chamber wash reduced intraocular pressure to 24â€“26mmHg, but visual acuity did not improve. Another episode of hyphema occurred, yet intraocular pressure remained stable.",
