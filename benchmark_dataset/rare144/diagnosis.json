        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Pierson syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical history including bilateral high myopia, cataract extraction, episodes of hyphema, nystagmus, and other ocular findings such as optic nerve atrophy and neovascularisation of the iris. The patient's complex medical history, including kidney transplantation and management of nephrotic syndrome, along with the presence of intraocular pressure changes and visual complications, were considered in the diagnostic process."
