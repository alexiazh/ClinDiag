        "final_diagnosis": "Clozapine-induced myocarditis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of clozapine-induced myocarditis was supported by the patient's elevated serum troponin levels, which rose from <0.3 ng/ml to a peak of 38.6 ng/ml, and the presence of significant clinical features such as fever, tachycardia, lethargy, and disorientation following the initiation of clozapine. Initial evaluations suggested medication-induced delirium possibly related to a urinary tract infection, but the rapid deterioration of cardiac function and subsequent echocardiographic findings confirming wall motion abnormalities led the cardiology team to conclude that clozapine-induced myocarditis was the most likely cause."
