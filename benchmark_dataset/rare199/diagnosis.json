        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome was indicated by the patient's presentation with epigastric pain, elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and ultrasound findings of a sub-hepatic hematoma. The history of a high-risk pregnancy at 32 weeks coupled with significant laboratory findings supports the diagnosis."
