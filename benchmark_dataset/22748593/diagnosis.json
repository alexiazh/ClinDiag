        "final_diagnosis": "Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis with recurrent herpes simplex and varicella infections due to STAT1 deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients exhibited recurrent oral and genital candidosis, recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and a known mutation in the STAT1 gene. Serum immunoglobulin levels were normal, but there was impaired release of interleukin-17. The clinical presentation of chronic candidosis alongside recurrent viral infections, particularly in the context of STAT1 mutations, supports the final diagnosis."
