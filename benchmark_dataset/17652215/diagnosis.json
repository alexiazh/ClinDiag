        "differential_diagnosis": "Achondroplasia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited marked short stature, disproportionate mesomelic shortening of the arms, and a specific mutation in the NPR2 gene (L658F) that affects cGMP production. These findings led to the conclusion of AMDM rather than achondroplasia, initially diagnosed at 3 months of age."
