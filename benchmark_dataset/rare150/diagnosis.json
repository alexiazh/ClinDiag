        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of STAR syndrome was confirmed by microarray analysis revealing a likely pathogenic 150 kilobase deletion of chromosome Xq28 that contains the FAM58A gene. The presence of multiple congenital abnormalities and additional findings such as telecanthus, imperforate anus, bilateral hydronephrosis, and visual impairments supported this diagnosis."
