        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient has a long history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus complicated by lupus cerebritis and anti-phospholipid syndrome, which is pertinent to the context of his symptoms. The eruption of innumerable pink-tan colored papules on the patient's skin, consistent with sebaceous adenoma as shown in biopsy results, and the notable response to isotretinoin therapy, including significant flattening of lesions and reduction in number, supported the diagnosis of Isotretinoin syndrome."
