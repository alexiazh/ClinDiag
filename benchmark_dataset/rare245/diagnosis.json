        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's clinical presentation of throbbing pain, intraoral examination revealing tenderness and mobility of the affected tooth, and radiographic findings that indicated a well-defined radiopacity and periapical radiolucency. Previous history of an odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) and its management also contributed to this diagnosis."
