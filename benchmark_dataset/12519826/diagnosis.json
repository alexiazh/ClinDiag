        "final_diagnosis": "Familial Combined Pituitary Hormone Deficiency (CPHD) due to a Novel Mutation R99Q in the PROP-1 gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CPHD was established after initial misdiagnosis of constitutional growth delay. Subsequent hormonal evaluations revealed deficiencies in GH, TSH, and gonadotropins, which prompted molecular analysis that identified a novel homozygous mutation (296G3A) in the PROP-1 gene that led to the substitution of arginine by glutamine at codon 99 (R99Q). This mutation was linked to the observed hormonal deficiencies."
