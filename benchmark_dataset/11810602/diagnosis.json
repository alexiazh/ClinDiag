        "differential_diagnosis": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE) was confirmed through brain biopsy, which showed peri-vascular hemorrhagic necrosis, patchy demyelination, and an inflammatory infiltrate predominantly composed of neutrophils. Negative tests for viral and bacterial infections and the patient's clinical presentation, including severe cerebral edema and neurological deficits, supported the diagnosis. The high peripheral WBC count and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) also indicated AHLE over other conditions."
