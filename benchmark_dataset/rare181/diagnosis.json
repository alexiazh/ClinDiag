        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Auriculocondylar syndrome was based on the patient's clinical presentation with core phenotypes including decreased mouth opening, micrognathia, microstomia, prominent cheeks, glossoptosis, and postauricular tags, combined with imaging findings of a narrowed oropharynx airway, absent condylar fossae, and other mandibular anomalies. Further diagnostic tests, including CT scans and whole-exome sequencing, supported the diagnosis."
