        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a family history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), abdominal pain, and intermittent bloody stools. Colonoscopy showed numerous polyps and biopsies revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of FAP was supported by these findings and the subsequent 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed diffuse intense FDG activity along the colorectum, indicating the extent of the disease."
