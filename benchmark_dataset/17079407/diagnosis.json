        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with neck pain and decreased range of motion, and imaging revealed anterior subluxation of C2 on C3 with segmental kyphosis. Despite the absence of a trauma history, the combination of the patient's clinical features, imaging results, and the characteristic traits of Marfan syndrome led to the final diagnosis. Ligamentous laxity associated with Marfan syndrome was hypothesized to contribute to the progressive cervical subluxations observed postoperatively."
