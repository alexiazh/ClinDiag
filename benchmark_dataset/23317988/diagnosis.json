        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included a 5-year history of progressively worsening diarrhea, weight loss, weakness, and sensory loss, along with family history of similar symptoms. Diagnostic tests, including multiple nerve conduction studies and biopsies, initially failed to identify the condition. However, histopathological examination of eyelid and oral mucosa biopsies showed amyloid deposits, and immunohistochemical studies confirmed TTR as an amyloid component. DNA sequencing revealed a novel mutation in the TTR gene, leading to the diagnosis of transthyretin amyloidosis."
