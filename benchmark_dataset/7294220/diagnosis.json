        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited chronic bilateral eyelid spasms that were exacerbated by stress and associated with emotional distress from life events. Her symptoms were supported by consistent electromyographic (EMG) evidence of muscle tension and functional shortness of breath. The context of her symptoms, including her family history and psychological state, indicated a psychogenic component contributing to blepharospasm."
