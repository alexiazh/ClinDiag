    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Neurocysticercosis, inactive, with temporal-lobe epilepsy",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Cysticercosis, mesial temporal sclerosis, vascular lesions, tumors, traumatic lesions, mycobacterial infection, other granulomatous diseases",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's seizure history, focal calcification in the medial temporal lobe on neuroimaging, and the nature of the lesion suggest neurocysticercosis. The long history of seizures, the specific aura reported, and the imaging characteristics point towards the lesion being the cause of his epilepsy. The presence of a tuberculin-positive test and the stabilized lesion over time also support this diagnosis."
