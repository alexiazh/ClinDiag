        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's rapidly progressive dyspnea, marked hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, and discordant pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) suggested pulmonary hypertension and possible tumor thromboembolic complications. Autopsy findings revealed organizing thromboemboli containing metastatic carcinoma, confirming the diagnosis of PTTM."
