        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of characteristic ocular manifestations, such as uveitis and iris bombe, combined with granulomatous skin lesions and a family history of similar symptoms, supported the diagnosis of Blau syndrome. Genetic analysis confirmed an R334W mutation in the CARD15/Nod2 gene in the proband and his sister, consistent with the diagnosis."
