        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute neurologic symptoms, fever, and MRI findings suggestive of an acute focal inflammatory process in the temporal lobe, raising concern for viral encephalitis, particularly herpes simplex. Although initial PCR tests for HSV were negative, the high pretest probability based on clinical presentation and imaging indicated an empirical treatment approach was appropriate. A brain biopsy later confirmed the presence of HSV-infected cells."
