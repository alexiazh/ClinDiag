        "final_diagnosis": "Burst fracture of the twelfth thoracic vertebra with incomplete spinal cord injury",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with worsening back pain, lower extremity weakness, and neurological deficits after a fall. MRI confirmed a burst fracture at the T12 vertebra with retropulsion of a fragment into the spinal canal. Due to the progressive neurologic deficit and signs of spinal cord compression, surgical intervention was selected as the most appropriate treatment."
