        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. P is a 41-year-old woman with symptoms of menorrhagia, anemia, and fatigue attributed to uterine fibroids. Her history of heavy and prolonged menses, the presence of an enlarged pelvic mass confirmed by pelvic examination and ultrasound, along with her iron-deficiency anemia, support this diagnosis. Previous myomectomy was only temporarily effective, and new fibroids have developed, leading to symptom recurrence."
