        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation, neuroimaging studies, and histopathological findings strongly suggest Rasmussen's encephalitis due to unilateral cortical atrophy and significant chronic inflammation in the left hemisphere. The EEG findings and multiple consultations further support this diagnosis while also considering the possibility of focal cortical dysplasia."
