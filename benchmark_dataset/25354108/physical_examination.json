The palate was elevated symmetrically, and the tongue protruded along the midline. Continuous twitching of the right lower facial muscles. Normal muscle bulk, tone, and strength in the left arm and leg. In the right arm, strength was 4/5 proximally with little movement of fingers or wrist and distal-muscle spasticity. Strength in the right leg was 4+/5 with slightly increased reflexes. Mildly hemiparetic gait.",
