        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of pyknodysostosis was reached after the provisional diagnosis of osteopetrosis was ruled out based on morphological, phenotypic, and radiographic characteristics. The presence of the patient's familial history and the distinct clinical features of pyknodysostosis confirmed the diagnosis."
