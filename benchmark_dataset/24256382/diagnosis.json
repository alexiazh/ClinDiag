        "final_diagnosis": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia (Evans syndrome) due to systemic lupus erythematosus.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, infections, drugs, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and other hematologic disorders.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, dyspnea, bruising, and dark urine, along with laboratory findings supporting hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Key evidence included a positive direct antiglobulin test, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and low haptoglobin levels. The history of recurrent symptoms and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies suggested a diagnosis of Evans syndrome, potentially linked to systemic lupus erythematosus."
