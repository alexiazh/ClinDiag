        "final_diagnosis": "Cockayne syndrome type 1",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Cockayne syndrome type 1 was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, congenital bilateral cataracts, developmental delay, and results from neuroimaging that showed significant progression with loss of brain volume and abnormal white matter signal. The patient's early diagnosis at 1 year of age and the observed multi-system involvement leading to multiorgan failure at age 8 further substantiate this diagnosis."
