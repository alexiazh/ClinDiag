        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Caroli disease was supported by the presence of multiple cysts in the liver, hepatosplenomegaly, and the prominent dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts observed through abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, and MRCP. The presence of the 'central spot sign' on imaging further validated the diagnosis."
