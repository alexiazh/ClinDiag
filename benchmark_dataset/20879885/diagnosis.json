        "differential_diagnosis": "Spitz nevus, atypical Spitz tumor, borderline lesion",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The lesion exhibited characteristics of malignancy, including marked cellular pleomorphism, atypical nuclei, and evidence of mitotic activity. The original lesion was previously categorized as an atypical Spitz tumor but was reassessed and designated as melanoma following the recurrence, as the cytologic features were distinctly malignant."
