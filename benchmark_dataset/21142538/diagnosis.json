        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included confusion, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Laboratory findings revealed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, all indicative of TTP, particularly in the context of her underlying lupus nephritis. The absence of renal failure and presence of neurological deficits favor TTP over hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed through specific laboratory tests."
