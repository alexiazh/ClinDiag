Urinalysis detected marked proteinuria (6 g protein/24 hours), and the glomerular filtration rate was 20 ml/min (normal; 120 ml/min).",

The right eye showed a Mittendorf dot and absence of central vessels, with a low serous retinal detachment. Similar findings were noted in the left eye, with an excavated disc and absent peripheral retinal vessels.",
