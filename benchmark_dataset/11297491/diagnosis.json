        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of papillorenal syndrome was based on the characteristic ocular findings of absent central retinal vessels and the presence of multiple cilioretinal vessels. Clinical and imaging studies revealed superonasal visual field defects and renal hypoplasia in affected family members. The absence of PAX2 gene mutations suggests that other genetic factors may contribute to the syndrome."
