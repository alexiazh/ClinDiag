        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The fetal karyotype indicated an unbalanced chromosomal translocation with additional material from chromosome 1 at band 42.1, correlating with the mother's balanced translocation 46,XX,t(1;18)(q42.1;p11.2). The unbalanced nature of the translocation suggests serious potential fetal anomalies, leading to the decision to terminate the pregnancy."
