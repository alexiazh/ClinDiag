        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures (NES) was established based on Ms. A's clinical history and the absence of epileptiform activity during continuous video EEG monitoring while hospitalized. The neurologist confirmed the diagnosis, which was well accepted by Ms. A and her mother. Additionally, family conflict was identified as a trigger for Ms. A's NES events, leading to a family-focused treatment approach."
