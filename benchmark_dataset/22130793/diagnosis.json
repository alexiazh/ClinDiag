        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient and his sister exhibited intrauterine growth retardation and severe postnatal growth failure. Molecular analysis revealed novel compound heterozygous IGF1R mutations (E121K and E234K), which caused significantly reduced IGF1R activation and signaling despite elevated IGF-I levels, leading to profound IGF1R deficiency and the clinically significant phenotype observed."
