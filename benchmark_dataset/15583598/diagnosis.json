    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Multiple hereditary infundibulocystic basal cell carcinoma, multiple hereditary trichoepitheliomas, generalized basaloid follicular hamartoma syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included palmar pits and numerous skin-colored papules, which met the criteria for nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Additionally, although the patient presented with characteristics resembling other syndromes, the presence of palmar pits prompted the diagnosis of BCNS despite the lack of genetic mutations definitively associated with it."
