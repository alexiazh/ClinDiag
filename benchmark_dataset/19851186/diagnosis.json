        "final_diagnosis": "disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection",
        "differential_diagnosis": "suspected metastatic lesions from primary bronchus carcinoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Initial PET/CT scan showed high F-18 FDG uptake in pulmonary lesions and an abdominal mass, leading to concerns of malignancy. However, subsequent biopsies revealed no malignancy. Improvement of clinical symptoms and reduction in lesion size on follow-up scans supported the diagnosis of MAC infection, likely due to immunosuppression from methotrexate."
