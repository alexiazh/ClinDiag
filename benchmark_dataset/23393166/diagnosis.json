        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe hypophosphatemia and elevated FGF23 levels, which were consistent with oncogenic osteomalacia. Immunohistochemical analysis of the adenocarcinoma confirmed strong staining for FGF23. This case represents the first documentation of a malignant neoplasm, specifically stage IV colon adenocarcinoma, producing FGF23."
