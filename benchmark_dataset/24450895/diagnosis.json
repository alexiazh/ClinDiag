        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis characterized by low complement levels, an abnormal serum free light-chain ratio, and a clonal B-cell population. The presence of pseudothrombi and necrotizing vasculitis in the renal biopsy confirmed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. Other possibilities such as anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis were considered but were ruled out based on the clinical presentation and test results."
