        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included severe headache, confusion, neck stiffness, and cognitive impairment, along with exceedingly high HIV RNA levels in CSF. MRI findings and CSF abnormalities were suggestive of acute meningoencephalitis, and the absence of JC virus DNA in CSF samples excluded AIDS dementia complex and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
