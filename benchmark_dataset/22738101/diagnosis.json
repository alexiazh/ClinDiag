        "final_diagnosis": "Goodpasture's syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Anti-GBM disease, Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura, IgA nephropathy, Cryoglobulinemia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with rapidly progressive renal failure, leg edema, and hemoptysis. A kidney biopsy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear IgG staining along the GBM, which is diagnostic of anti-GBM disease, specifically Goodpasture's syndrome. Initial serologic testing for anti-GBM antibodies was negative, but subsequent Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of antibodies, thereby supporting the diagnosis."
