        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is supported by the association between heparin treatment and the patient's thrombocytopenia occurring after a delay, rather than immediately following heparin administration. The evidence includes references to studies that document these incidences, highlighting the distinct forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (1 and 2 as mentioned), and demonstrating a need for clear differentiation between them."
