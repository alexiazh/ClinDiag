    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Syncope due to arrhythmia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with syncope while jogging, had a history of previous episodes, and showed electrocardiogram changes indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy. A transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, revealing asymmetric septal hypertrophy and normal systolic function, which aligned with the diagnosis."
