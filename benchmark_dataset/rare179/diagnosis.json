        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome was supported by the presence of unique facial features, congenital anomalies (such as hydronephrosis and cardiac defects), and the identification of a heterozygous variant in the SETBP1 gene. The variant's classification as likely pathogenic and its in silico predictions indicated significant functional impact, aligning with the clinical symptoms observed."
