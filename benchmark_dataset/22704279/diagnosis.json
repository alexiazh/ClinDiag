        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms of palpitation and breathlessness, physical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur, and echocardiograms confirmed the presence of an aneurysm of the anterior mitral leaflet. The findings were corroborated by intraoperative observations of a dome-shaped aneurysm without clots, which aligned with the characteristics of true aneurysms as described in the literature."
