        "final_diagnosis": "Hyperornithinemia-Hyperammonemia-Homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of HHH syndrome was confirmed by the identification of the homozygous p.R275Q mutation in SLC25A15, consistent with the characteristic metabolic triad. The patient exhibited severe progressive retinal degeneration, which is considered similar to findings in gyrate atrophy. While both conditions present with similar ophthalmological signs, the presence of the HHH syndrome's specific metabolic derangements supported the final diagnosis."
