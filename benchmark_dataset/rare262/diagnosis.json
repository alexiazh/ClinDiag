        "final_diagnosis": "Staphylococcal necrotizing pneumonia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of multiple thin-wall cavitary lesions suggestive of pneumatoceles on imaging and confirmation of Staphylococcus aureus in cultures from blood, tracheal and pleural samples. The patient's clinical deterioration, including respiratory failure leading to intubation and ventilation, along with the development of repeated ventilator-associated pneumonia, also contributed to establishing the diagnosis."
