        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation included acute cough with hemoptysis, high fever, and rapid clinical decline. Initial cultures and tests suggested a bacterial pneumonia, but the identification of Yersinia pestis in follow-up tests highlighted the likely diagnosis of pneumonic plague. The occupational exposure to rodents and the history of recent dog illness further supported this diagnosis."
