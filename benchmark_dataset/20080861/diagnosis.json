        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia was established based on the presence of specific mutations in the STAR gene, leading to adrenal insufficiency, elevated ACTH levels, and impaired steroid hormone biosynthesis. The clinical manifestation included acute crisis with hypotensive episodes, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia in neonates, along with complete sex reversal in 46,XY cases, which is characteristic of this condition."
