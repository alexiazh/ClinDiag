        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was made in the context of the patient presenting with fetal growth restriction (FGR). The male newborn's weight was notably low (<3%), which is consistent with the characteristics of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The thorough assessments throughout the pregnancy, including multiple ultrasounds, indicated no structural defects, but the growth parameters and the resultant low weight led to the diagnosis."
