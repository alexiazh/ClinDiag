        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant presented with feeding problems, irritability, hypertonia, and global developmental delay. MRI findings suggested leukodystrophy, and nerve-conduction studies indicated demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Elevated CSF protein and depressed N-acetyl aspartate peak on spectroscopy pointed towards Krabbe disease. Genetic testing confirmed mutations in the galactosylceramidase gene, aligning with the infantile form of Krabbe disease."
