        "final_diagnosis": "Metastatic choriocarcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Nonseminomatous germ-cell tumor, hyperthyroidism, gynecomastia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient showed symptoms of gynecomastia and hyperthyroidism alongside significant imaging findings such as multiple lung and liver lesions and a massive retroperitoneal nodal mass. The markedly elevated hCG level (higher than 1,000,000 IU per liter) and the diagnosis established through biopsy confirmed the presence of choriocarcinoma, likely of testicular origin."
