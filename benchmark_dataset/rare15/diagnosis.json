        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through genetic testing which identified a loss of methylation (LOM) of the KCNQ1OT1:TSS DMR in both twins, consistent with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Additionally, clinical features in ST such as macroglossia and a wide glabellar nevus simplex were also noted, along with the successful removal of a cystic neuroblastoma."
