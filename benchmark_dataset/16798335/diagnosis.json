        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of total diaphragmatic eventration was established based on the presence of progressive exertional dyspnea, a clinical examination that revealed auscultatory bruising, and imaging studies showing a high displacement of the left hemidiaphragm with compressive atelectasis of the lower lobe. Ventilatory function tests indicated a mild restrictive pattern, and intraoperative findings confirmed large eventration of the left hemidiaphragm."
