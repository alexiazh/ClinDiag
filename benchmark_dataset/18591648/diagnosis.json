        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was confirmed through autopsy which revealed symmetric cardiac hypertrophy. JAK2 mutation V617F was detected in approximately 50% of DNA from atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, indicating a functional link between the mutation and myocardial hypertrophy."
