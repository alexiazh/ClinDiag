        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Norwegian scabies was supported by the presence of Sarcoptes scabiei mites found in mineral oil preparations from the scalp and nails, alongside the characteristic presentation of thick greasy scaling of the scalp and hyperkeratotic nails, despite the absence of pruritus which is typical in immunocompromised patients."
