        "final_diagnosis": "Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Myasthenia gravis, inflammatory diseases of the muscles (polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion-body myositis), autoimmune conditions (e.g., Sjögren’s syndrome)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with proximal muscle weakness without sensory or reflex abnormalities, which pointed towards the neuromuscular junction. The absence of typical features of myasthenia gravis (ocular or oropharyngeal symptoms) and the presence of dry mouth and cognitive dysfunction suggested Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Confirmatory tests showed a decremental response consistent with presynaptic defects. Antibody testing confirmed the diagnosis in the context of the patient’s symptoms and a significant weight of evidence found in the neurodiagnostic results."
