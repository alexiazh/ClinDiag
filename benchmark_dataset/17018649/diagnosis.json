        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of MIDD was supported by the patient's confirmed genetic mutation (A3243G in the tRNA), a strong family history of diabetes and hearing loss among siblings, the onset of diabetes at age 33 with progression to insulin dependence, and the presence of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Key clinical findings such as low C-peptide levels and negative islet cell antibodies further indicated an insulin secretory defect rather than type 1 or type 2 diabetes."
