        "final_diagnosis": "viral pneumonia caused by 2009 A(H1N1) virus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by robust detection of the influenza A virus in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens, while nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for the virus. Key evidence included the clinical presentation with predominant lower respiratory tract symptoms, the presence of bilateral patchy consolidation on chest CT, and temporal correlation between respiratory symptom worsening and viral shedding in the upper airway. Testing results indicated active viral replication primarily in the lower respiratory tract."
