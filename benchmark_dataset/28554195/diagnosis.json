        "final_diagnosis": "type III hereditary angioedema",

        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had severe angioedema while on the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin without an ACEI. Normal C1-INH levels and function, along with a heterozygous Thr328Lys mutation in the coagulation factor XII gene, support the diagnosis of type III hereditary angioedema. The severity of this episode was considered uncharacteristic and likely exacerbated by sitagliptin."
