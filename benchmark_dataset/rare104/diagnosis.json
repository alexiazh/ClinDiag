        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Kearns-Sayre syndrome was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of progressive vision loss, difficulty opening his eyes, bilateral ptosis, and growth retardation. Key findings included hyperpigmentation of both eyes, visual field defects, and specific retinal findings on optical coherence tomography. Genetic testing revealed a deletion in mitochondrial DNA, which is characteristic of Kearns-Sayre syndrome."
