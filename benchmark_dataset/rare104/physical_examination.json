            "relevant_findings": "Color fundus photography showed hyperpigmentation of both eyes. Binocular perimetric examination revealed a superior temporal visual field defect and centripetal reduction in both eyes. Macular spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed an interruption in the ellipsoid band, and several hyperreflective deposits above the retinal pigment epithelium were observed. Average subfoveal choroidal thickness: 223 μm (left eye), 224 μm (right eye). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed decreased deep retinal capillary density and significant atrophy of choroid microvessels.",
