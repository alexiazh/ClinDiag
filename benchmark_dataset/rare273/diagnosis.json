        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with acute onset of dyspnea and lower extremity edema, accompanied by echocardiography findings of a large pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology. Past medical history included stable limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, which is consistent with her presentation. The resolution of symptoms after starting corticosteroids supports the diagnosis."
