        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of non-immune hydrops fetalis was made based on ultrasound findings at 22 weeks of gestation showing generalized skin edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and peritoneal effusions in the fetus. Further genetic testing indicated a homozygous missense variant in the GUSB gene, confirming the genetic etiology of the condition."
