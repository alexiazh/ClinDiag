        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of acquired factor X deficiency was supported by clinical symptoms of severe bleeding (hematuria and epistaxis), laboratory findings showing prolonged PT and APTT with reduced factor X levels, and the negative Bethesda factor X inhibitor titer. The improvement of coagulation parameters after treatment and the absence of hereditary bleeding disorders also contributed to this diagnosis."
