        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Trisomy 18 was supported by the clinical presentation of features typical of Wiedemannâ€“Rautenstrauch syndrome, including craniofacial abnormalities, eye defects, and other congenital anomalies. Genetic testing revealed compound heterozygous variants in the FREM1 gene that were predicted to be damaging, with confirmation of segregation within the family. The absence of these variants in public databases further supports the relevance of these findings to the patient's condition."
