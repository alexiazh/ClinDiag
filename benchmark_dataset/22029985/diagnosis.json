    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Tumor-induced osteomalacia due to metastatic ameloblastic fibrosarcoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "FGF23-dependent hypophosphatemia, renal Fanconi syndrome, primary hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's recurrent hypophosphatemia and associated bone pain suggest a disorder affecting bone mineralization, specifically osteomalacia. Laboratory tests showed significantly low serum phosphorus and normal parathyroid hormone levels, indicating renal phosphate wasting rather than malnutrition. The patient had a history of a jaw tumor, suggesting a potential FGF23-producing tumor. Imaging and elevated FGF23 levels confirmed tumor-induced osteomalacia due to an underlying malignant neoplasm."
