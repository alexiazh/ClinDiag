        "final_diagnosis": "Midline palate perforation due to cocaine abuse",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Infection caused by tuberculosis, tertiary syphilis, leishmaniasis, mucormycosis, actinomycosis, diphtheria, leprosy, traumatic injury (including chemical trauma), neoplastic melanoma, metastatic carcinoma, midline destructive granuloma, and collagen vascular disease (immunologic disease)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of cocaine abuse, which is known to cause nasal and palate ischemia, leading to necrosis and perforation. Physical examination revealed a fistula in the hard palate and a large septal perforation. Additionally, the patient presented with symptoms of hypernasality and nasal air emission, which are consistent with damage caused by prolonged cocaine use."
