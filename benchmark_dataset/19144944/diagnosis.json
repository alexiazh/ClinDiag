        "differential_diagnosis": "Septic shock due to other infections, cellulitis, snakebite",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis was made based on clinical presentation of shock, severe pain and tenderness at the site, rapid progression of symptoms following a minor skin wound, and radiographic findings showing soft-tissue swelling with no evidence of abscess formation. Additionally, the pathology revealed liquefactive necrosis and abundant gram-positive cocci, consistent with group A streptococcal infection."
