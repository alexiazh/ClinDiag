        "final_diagnosis": "Combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency due to EFG1 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the identification of a mutation in the EFG1 gene, which affects mitochondrial translation and results in reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, coupled with clinical symptoms of progressive hepatoencephalopathy in siblings. Key laboratory findings such as profound metabolic acidosis, elevated blood lactate levels, liver dysfunction, and postmortem findings of cholestasis and necrosis supported this diagnosis."
