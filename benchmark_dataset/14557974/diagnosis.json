        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The cases presented involved organ transplant recipients who developed rapidly fatal disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Both recipients received organs from a donor with unrecognized active coccidioidomycosis. Postmortem examinations revealed microabscesses and numerous spherules consistent with C. immitis in multiple organs. Culture results confirmed the presence of C. immitis, supporting the diagnosis."
