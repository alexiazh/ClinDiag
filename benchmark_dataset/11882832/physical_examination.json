Peak dynamic gradient across the LVOT was 88 mm Hg after provocation with exercise. During intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram: no resting or provokable gradient across the LVOT, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.",

On the seventh postoperative day, transient ischemic attacks occurred with visual field disturbances. Repeated transesophageal echocardiogram showed nonmobile echo densities in the LVOT, suggestive of thrombi."
