        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showing echo densities suggestive of thrombi at the myectomy site, and MRI confirmed the presence of pedunculated intracavitary masses in the LVOT consistent with thrombi. The patient also experienced postoperative transient ischemic attacks, raising suspicion of an embolic origin."
