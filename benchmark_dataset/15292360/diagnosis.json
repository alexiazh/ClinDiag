        "final_diagnosis": "Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma and Pheochromocytoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited a codon 891 mutation in the RET protooncogene, which is associated with intermediate-risk familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) but has now been linked to pheochromocytoma. Genetic analysis confirmed the mutation, and the family history of hypertension and associated tumors supported the diagnosis. Histopathology showed MTC with C cell hyperplasia, and there was no evidence of other conditions previously ruled out after surgery and follow-up."
