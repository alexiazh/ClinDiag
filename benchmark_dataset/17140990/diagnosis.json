        "final_diagnosis": "familial membranous subaortic stenosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of familial membranous subaortic stenosis was supported by the presence of a subaortic membrane observed in echocardiography of both patients, along with significant left ventricular hypertrophy, high LVOT pressure gradients, and familial clustering in affected siblings. Surgical intervention and histopathological findings also confirmed the diagnosis."
