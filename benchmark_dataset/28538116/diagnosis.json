        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's age, the changing nature and increasing size of the uterine mass, and the presence of features on imaging suggestive of degeneration raised concern for an underlying malignant process. Ultimately, intraoperative findings and pathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of high-grade leiomyosarcoma, supported by cytologic atypia, increased mitosis, and tumor-cell necrosis."
