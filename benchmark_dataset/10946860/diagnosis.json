    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Triple H Syndrome (Isolated ACTH deficiency, anterograde memory impairment, alopecia areata)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis-associated encephalopathy, other autoimmune disorders",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Triple H Syndrome was supported by the presence of isolated ACTH deficiency, significant impairment in anterograde memory without a decline in retrograde memory, and distinct features of alopecia in both subjects. The neuropsychological assessments showed a specific amentia pattern associated with brain scans revealing hypoperfusion and atrophy in the hippocampus, along with the presence of autoimmune antibodies. The shared autoimmune targets affecting the hippocampus, hair follicle, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suggest a novel autoimmune etiology."
