        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The acute onset of flank pain, coupled with fever, new heart murmurs, and imaging findings indicating a wedge-shaped renal infarct, pointed towards renal infarction. The presence of normal urinalysis and hypertension further supported an acute kidney insult due to a thromboembolic event, consistent with endocarditis, especially considering the patient's recent vaccination and asplenic state heightening infection risk."
