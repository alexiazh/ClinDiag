        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made incidentally during the evaluation of an abnormal chest radiograph obtained for cutaneous melanoma. Biopsy revealed non-necrotizing granulomas, and a CT scan showed small mediastinal lymphadenopathy and nodules consistent with sarcoidosis. Ms K's chronic symptoms of fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and lower extremity achiness also contributed to the diagnostic consideration."
