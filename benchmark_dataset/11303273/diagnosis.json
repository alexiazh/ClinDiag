        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited slow resolution of anemia following the administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with persistent parvovirus B19 infection confirmed by PCR. Initial absence of antibody response and the eventual detection of antibodies along with the control of parvovirus B19 load after salvage therapy indicated that cellular immunity played a crucial role in reconstituted immune function against the persistent infection."
