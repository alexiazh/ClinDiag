        "final_diagnosis": "Transient thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy associated with resistance to thyroid hormone",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's history of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), characterized by elevated free T3 and T4 levels with suppressed TSH during pregnancy, along with symptoms suggesting hyperthyroidism. Key findings included a significant rise in thyroid hormone levels coinciding with increased hCG during early gestation, followed by a spontaneous decline of symptoms and hormone levels later in pregnancy."
