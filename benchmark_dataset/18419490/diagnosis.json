        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The child presented with new-onset blistering, erythema, and vesicular lesions after contact with his father, who had received smallpox vaccination. Initial tests ruled out herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus, but PCR tests confirmed the presence of nonvariola orthopoxvirus, specifically vaccinia virus, in the childâ€™s lesions. This was in line with the clinical history of potential exposure, leading to the diagnosis of eczema vaccinatum."
