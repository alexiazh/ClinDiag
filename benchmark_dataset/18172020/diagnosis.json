        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patients with anxious depression exhibited lower remission rates and took longer to achieve remission compared to those with nonanxious depression. Symptoms included excessive worry, insomnia, and physical complaints. The presence of anxiety symptoms was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and patients meeting the criteria were classified as having anxious depression."
