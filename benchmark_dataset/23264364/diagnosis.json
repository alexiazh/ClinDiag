        "final_diagnosis": "Decompensated cirrhosis secondary to primary hepatitis C virus infection in an HIV-infected patient",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Four HIV-infected men progressed to decompensated cirrhosis within 17 months to 6 years after primary hepatitis C virus infection. The rapid onset of fibrosis and subsequent progression to liver failure was primarily due to the degree of underlying immunocompromise caused by HIV infection, as evidenced by the low CD4 counts at the time of HCV infection."
