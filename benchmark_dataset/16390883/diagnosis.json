        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited acute psychosis 52 days after gastric bypass surgery, characterized by hallucinations and aggressive behavior. Initial attribution of symptoms to scopolamine was considered but disproved as symptoms persisted despite discontinuation. Evaluation for medical causes like infection and electrolyte imbalance were negative. Symptoms improved significantly following treatment for anastomotic stenosis and resolution of vomiting, supporting a diagnosis of acute psychosis likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies related to the surgical procedure."
