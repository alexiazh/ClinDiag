        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Malacoplakia was diagnosed based on histopathological examination revealing sheets of histiocytes and macrophages containing Michaelisâ€“Guttmann bodies, which are pathognomonic for the condition. The patient's advanced HIV infection and the aggressive nature of the lesions prompted the consideration of malacoplakia, especially given the lack of growth in cultures and the characteristic imaging findings."
