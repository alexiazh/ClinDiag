    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (PORD) with aromatase deficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "21-hydroxylase deficiency, transient intrauterine virilization due to maternal luteoma or aromatase deficiency",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by the identification of compound heterozygous mutations in the POR gene that resulted in severe loss of activity in CYP19A1, confirming aromatase deficiency. Evidence included the patient's signs of virilization, elevated testosterone levels at birth, and the absence of defects in CYP19A1 itself."
