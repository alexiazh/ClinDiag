        "differential_diagnosis": "Infection, cardiovascular complications, noninfectious pulmonary complications, pulmonary embolic disease, accelerated phase of chronic interstitial lung disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of occupational exposure to asbestos and presented with respiratory symptoms, radiographic evidence of interstitial fibrosis, and acute deterioration consistent with an exacerbation of chronic interstitial lung disease. The echocardiographic findings indicated right heart failure due to pulmonary disease, which correlated with the diagnosis of accelerated pulmonary asbestosis."
