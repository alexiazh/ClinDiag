        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical symptoms—including cognitive dysfunction, tremor, gait imbalance, and MRI findings showing diffuse T2-weighted hyperintensities—suggest a multifocal process likely related to his HIV status. The detection of lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein in the CSF, along with the significantly elevated CSF HIV RNA levels despite a low plasma viral load, indicates HIV CSF viral escape syndrome as the mechanism behind his neurological manifestations."
