        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, eosinophilia, and imaging results suggesting a colonic mass necessitated further evaluation. Colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated noncircumferential mass in the ascending colon. The biopsy results did not confirm cancer, but were insufficient to rule it out. The significant eosinophilia warranted a differential diagnosis that included parasitic infections, particularly given the patient's history and geographic exposure. The histological examination revealed characteristic findings supporting A. costaricensis infection."
