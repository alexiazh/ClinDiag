        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of probable SARS was based on traveling history, clinical manifestations, CXR findings, and detailed workup to exclude common bacterial or viral infections. Polyradiculoneuropathy was diagnosed based on clinical and electrophysiologic findings consistent with CIP, which was considered due to chronic critical illness during hospitalization."
