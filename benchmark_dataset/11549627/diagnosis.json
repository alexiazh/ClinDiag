        "differential_diagnosis": "Testotoxicosis, virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal insufficiency due to autoimmune disease, adrenoleukodystrophy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The child presented with isosexual gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty and later developed clinical signs of severe primary adrenal insufficiency. Elevated testosterone levels and ineffective GnRH agonist therapy suggested gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. Genetic testing identified a frameshift mutation in the DAX1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita as the cause of both precocious puberty and adrenal insufficiency."
