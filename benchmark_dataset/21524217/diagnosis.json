        "final_diagnosis": "Adenocarcinoma of the rectum associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), due to an MSH6 mutation.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the pathological examination of biopsy specimens showing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in a villous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, alongside the presence of tubular adenomas in the colon. Imaging studies indicated a locally advanced rectal mass without evidence of metastasis, and microsatellite instability was observed, leading to the identification of an MSH6 mutation indicative of Lynch syndrome."
