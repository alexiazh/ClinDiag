        "final_diagnosis": "metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma was established after the patient presented with recurrent goiters, underwent multiple thyroid surgeries, and was confirmed via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a lesion in the right femur, which revealed metastatic cancer. Additional molecular analysis showed a homozygous G to A mutation in the splice donor site of intron 5 of the Tg gene, leading to the malignant transformation attributed to prolonged TSH stimulation due to dyshormonogenesis."
