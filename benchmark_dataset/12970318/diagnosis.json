        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of papillary thyroid cancer identified during a hemithyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism in one case, and a clear cell thyroid carcinoma found in another patient with long-standing McCune-Albright Syndrome. Molecular analysis revealed activating mutations of Arg201 in the GNAS1 gene in both cases, suggesting that additional mutational or epigenetic events contribute to malignancy in patients with MAS."
