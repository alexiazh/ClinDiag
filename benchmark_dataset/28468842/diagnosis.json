        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patients exhibited painless and progressive mutilating distal ulcerations leading to amputation and joint deformity, with a reduction in sensation to pain, touch, and vibration. Autonomic disturbances included hypohidrosis and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Severe axonal sensory neuropathy was confirmed through nerve conduction studies. Genetic analysis revealed two pathogenic mutations in the DST gene, specifically affecting the DST neuronal isoform-a2, linking the phenotype to HSAN-VI."
