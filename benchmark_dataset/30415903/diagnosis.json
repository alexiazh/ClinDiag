    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm due to PRKG1 mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient has a known PRKG1 heterozygous mutation and a strong family history of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, supporting early intervention. Intraoperative findings revealed an exceptionally thin aortic wall and significant familial patterns of aortic dissections, which indicated a need for aggressive prophylactic surgical management."
