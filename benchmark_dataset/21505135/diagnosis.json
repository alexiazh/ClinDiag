        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel, heterozygous 3-kilobase deletion removing exons 7-9 of TP53 in the patientâ€™s normal skin DNA, which was homozygous in the leukemia DNA due to uniparental disomy. The patient had early-onset breast and ovarian cancer, with negative BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and a complex karyotype in her leukemia involving monosomy 7 and del(5q). The absence of family history of cancer and the presence of multiple primary tumors suggested increased cancer susceptibility, leading to the diagnosis."
