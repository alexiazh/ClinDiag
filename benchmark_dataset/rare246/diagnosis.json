        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant presented with scattered yellow pustules and recurrent herpes, which progressed to warty crusting and hyperpigmentation, alongside high eosinophil levels and specific skin biopsy findings consistent with eosinophilic spongiform edema and microabscesses. Imaging studies revealed significant brain abnormalities, and genetic testing indicated chromosomal mosaicism that aligns with the typical presentation of Incontinentia pigmenti."
