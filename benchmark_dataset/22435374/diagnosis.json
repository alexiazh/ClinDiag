    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason score of 7 (grade 3 plus grade 4), predominantly anterior, pT2bN0Mx, with negative resection margins.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a persistently elevated serum PSA level for over 7 years, with only a small amount of low-grade cancer found on one of several biopsies. Subsequent biopsies and imaging studies revealed evidence of cancer in the anterior lobes of the prostate, and the TTMB allowed for better sampling and confirmed the presence of a larger-volume tumor with a Gleason score of 7, justifying aggressive treatment."
