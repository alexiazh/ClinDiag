His history of recurrent episodes consistent with hypoglycemia, improved with oral intake, and exacerbated by fasting and alcohol use supported the diagnosis of insulinoma. Additional investigations, including fasting studies, confirmed hypoglycemia during episodes, aligning with insulinoma characteristics."
