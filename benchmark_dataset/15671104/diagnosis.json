        "differential_diagnosis": "Nonclassical 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was primarily based on the elevation of 5-steroids before and after ACTH stimulation tests, confirmed by urinary analysis and molecular biology studies. The notably high levels of 17-hydroxypregnenolone, especially over 100 nmol/liter in basal or ACTH-stimulated conditions, were key indicators of 3β-HSD deficiency. Sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity for mutations in the HSD3B2 gene, and the elevated levels of 17-OHP suggested initial consideration of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which was ruled out upon further genetic analysis."
