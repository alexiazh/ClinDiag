        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of S. haematobium eggs found in semen specimens and a prostate biopsy. Patients exhibited hematospermia following travel to an endemic area, and previous symptoms like hematuria were noted in some cases. The long duration between exposure and symptom onset, along with normal urinalysis results, added complexity to the diagnosis. Travel history and exposure to freshwater were key factors in reaching the diagnosis."
