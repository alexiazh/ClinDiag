    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (most likely of prostatic origin), with ectopic corticotropin syndrome.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pheochromocytoma, hypothyroidism, primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal tumors, paraneoplastic syndromes.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The acute onset of hypertension, edema, and hyperglycemia, combined with new liver lesions, suggested potential metastatic disease. The presence of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and elevated basic natriuretic peptide, along with a rising PSA level, supported the suspicion of Cushing's syndrome possibly due to metastatic process. Imaging studies revealed multiple low-density lesions in the liver and enlarged adrenal glands. Hormonal testing confirmed hypercortisolism, leading to a clinical diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome secondary to metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma."
