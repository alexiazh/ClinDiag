        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by echocardiographic findings of mild Ebstein's anomaly, moderate tricuspid valve insufficiency, right heart enlargement, atrial septal defect, membranous VSD, and LVNC. The presence of these features in siblings and the identification of a novel MYH7 mutation also reinforced the diagnosis."
