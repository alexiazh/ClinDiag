        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A.M.'s major depression developed following a series of significant life events related to loss and isolation despite her pre-existing bilateral amygdala damage. Extensive diagnostic screening confirmed no other psychiatric disorders, and her resonant response to intravenous ketamine suggested a possible non-serotonin based mechanism for her treatment-resistant depression."
