        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Diagnosis was based on the clinical history, hormonal evaluation showing low levels of androgens with elevated progesterone, and an ACTH test demonstrating insufficient cortisol response. In vitro studies confirmed the absence of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in testis tissue."
