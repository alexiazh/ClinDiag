        "final_diagnosis": "Nonerythrodermic leukemic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of CD4+CD7–Th2 tumor cells lacking T-cell receptor/CD3 expression and the infiltration of a high percentage of nonmalignant CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, leading to a leukemic form of CTCL manifesting with non-aggressive skin nodules instead of typical erythroderma. Additionally, the absence of lymphadenopathy, internal organ involvement, and bone marrow invasion supported this diagnosis while excluding T-CLL and Sézary syndrome."
