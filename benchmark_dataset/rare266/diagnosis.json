        "final_diagnosis": "Neonatal lupus erythematosus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's extensive purpuric erosions, the characteristic 'X'-shaped configuration of the lesions, the mother's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, and laboratory findings such as positive antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. Additionally, negative results for HSV PCR, cytomegalovirus PCR, and serological evaluation consistent with congenital lupus confirmed the diagnosis."
