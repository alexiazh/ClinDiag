        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Giant axonal neuropathy was supported by the patient's clinical history, which included progressive weakness in both lower limbs over more than 6 years, as well as a family history of a similar condition in her deceased older brother. Thorough genomic testing and a muscle biopsy were performed to confirm the diagnosis. No specific physical examination findings or initial test results were reported."
