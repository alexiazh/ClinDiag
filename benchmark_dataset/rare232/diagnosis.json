        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Proteus syndrome was supported by the clinical presentation of irregular growth on the right foot, motor developmental delay, limb length discrepancies, and cerebriform connective tissue overgrowth. MRI findings indicated enlargement of the right foot and distinguishing features such as muscle atrophy and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. Vascular abnormalities were evident on angiography, further corroborating the diagnosis."
