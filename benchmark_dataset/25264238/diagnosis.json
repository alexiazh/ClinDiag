        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through histologic examination which showed diffuse proliferation of benign endothelial cells between collagen bundles in the dermis, alongside immunohistochemical staining results for CD31 and CD34. Negative staining for HHV-8 helped to differentiate DDA from other disorders."
