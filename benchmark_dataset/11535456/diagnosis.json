        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of DOA was based on the history of gradual, bilateral loss of vision beginning at an early age, reduced visual acuity, central or paracentral scotomas, optic disc pallor, and the presence of a negative work-up for other causes of optic atrophy. Key features distinguishing DOA from NTG include early age of onset, family history, and the specific pattern of optic disc pallor and excavation."
