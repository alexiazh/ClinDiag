        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning was supported by the patient's history of ingesting brake oil containing ethylene glycol, the development of symptoms including abdominal pain, vomiting, and reduced urine output, and laboratory findings of high anion gap metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. Urine screens for common toxins were negative, ruling out other potential causes."
