        "final_diagnosis": "Blau syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Blau syndrome was supported by the clinical presentation of the child, including intermittent high-grade fever, joint pain and swelling, and the presence of papular skin lesions. The family history of inflammatory deforming polyarthritis in the mother, along with the similar skin findings in the younger sister, pointed towards a genetic condition. Further, the identification of a pathogenic mutation in the NOD2 gene in the child and other family members further substantiated the diagnosis."
