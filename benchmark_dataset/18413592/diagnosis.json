        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Danon disease was supported by the presence of muscle weakness, gynecomastia, echocardiographic findings of left ventricular hypertrophy, and specific genetic analysis revealing a novel missense mutation in the LAMP2 gene. Additionally, abnormal muscle biopsy findings, including autophagic vacuoles and increased serum CK activity, were consistent with the diagnosis."
