        "differential_diagnosis": "Juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden’s disease, Bannayan–Ruvalcaba–Riley syndrome, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis is based on the presence of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, multiple gastrointestinal polyps, and extraintestinal vascular abnormalities consistent with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The patient met the Curaçao criteria for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and demonstrated features of juvenile polyposis. Genetic testing confirmed a germ-line mutation in the MADH4 gene linking the two syndromes."
