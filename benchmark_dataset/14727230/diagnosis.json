        "final_diagnosis": "disseminated phaeohyphomycosis due to Exophiala spinifera",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of disseminated phaeohyphomycosis was established based on the patient's clinical signs and symptoms, including skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and fever. The presence of dark, septate, branching hyphae and dark spherical elements in biopsy samples supported the diagnosis. Culturing E. spinifera confirmed the pathogen responsible for the patient's condition. Treatment with posaconazole resulted in clinical improvement and negative fungal cultures."
