    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Intracranial hypertension associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and glucocorticoid use.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, cerebral venous thrombosis, CNS vasculitis, increased intracranial pressure secondary to connective tissue disorders.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited bilateral optic-disk edema, transient visual loss, positional headaches exacerbated by bending over, and pulsatile tinnitus, indicating increased intracranial pressure. MRI and CSF analysis further ruled out other causes, suggesting the condition was related to systemic lupus erythematosus, possibly exacerbated by glucocorticoids."
