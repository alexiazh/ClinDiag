There was subchondral sclerosis in the medial hemi-joint space, lateral subluxation, and varus angulation. Significant subchondral cystic changes were identified involving the tibial plateau centrally as well as the medial femoral condyle, thought to represent geode formation from osteoarthrosis.",
