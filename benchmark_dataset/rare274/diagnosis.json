        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent fever, keratinized skin rashes, and significant laboratory findings such as elevated acute phase reactants and pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with decreased B lymphocytes, NK cells, and IgG. The absence of common autoimmune markers (ANA and ANCA) further supported the diagnosis of PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency."
