        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Miss W meets the definition of idiopathic short stature as her height is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for her age. The medical evaluation for secondary causes revealed no underlying disease. Laboratory tests, including thyroid function and a karyotype, were normal, and mutation screening for SHOX gene was negative. Her history of slow growth, delayed bone age, and lack of evidence for systemic illness supports the diagnosis of idiopathic short stature."
