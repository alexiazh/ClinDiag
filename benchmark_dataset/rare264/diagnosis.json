        "final_diagnosis": "Juvenile polymyositis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of juvenile polymyositis was supported by elevated CK serum levels, the onset of proximal muscle weakness following corticosteroid treatment, and the inflammatory changes observed on muscle biopsy. Negative tests for myositis-specific and associated antibodies, normal EMG and nerve conduction studies initially, and confirmation of LGMDR2 through whole-exome sequencing also contributed to the diagnostic process."
