        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Sanger sequencing of known T1HLP genes did not reveal disease-causing mutations. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous rare variants (p.Val103Met and p.Arg540Gln) in the GCKR gene, suggesting that these variants cause extreme hypertriglyceridemia likely by inducing excessive hepatic lipogenesis."
