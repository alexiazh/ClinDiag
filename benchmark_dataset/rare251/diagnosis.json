        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of transient neonatal myasthenia gravis was supported by clinical presentations such as dyspnea, cyanosis, and decreased reflexes at birth, along with significant test results indicating elevated AChR-Ab levels and respiratory acidosis. The rapid improvement after treatment with IVIG and pyridostigmine, along with the resolution of symptoms and normal development post-discharge, reinforced the diagnosis."
