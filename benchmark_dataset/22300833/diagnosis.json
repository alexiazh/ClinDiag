        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of multiple Spitz nevi is a rare phenomenon, defined as two or more distinct Spitz nevi in an individual patient. The majority of patients displayed histopathologic characteristics of classic Spitz nevi or a few atypical features, as evidenced by a retrospective analysis of nine patients with clinically diagnosed Spitz nevi, where most lesions were confirmed histologically."
