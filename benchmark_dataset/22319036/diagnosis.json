    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) due to homozygous mutations in the THRB gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical findings included compromised intellectual development, tachycardia, goiter, growth retardation, and hearing loss, which were more severe than those seen in heterozygous cases. The mutations resulted in a strong dominant-negative effect on the thyroid hormone receptor function, supported by clinical and laboratory abnormalities consistent with RTH."
