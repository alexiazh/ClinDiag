        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's symptoms of constant burning pain and vasomotor instability in both feet following nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis secondary to smoking heroin. Three-phase bone scintigraphy indicated increased radioactivity consistent with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and pain relief was achieved after calcitonin therapy."
