        "differential_diagnosis": "Progressive supranuclear palsy",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with progressive gait ataxia, myoclonic jerks, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease type C was confirmed with genetic testing showing two pathogenic variants of the NPC1 gene. The NPC suspicion index score was in the gray zone, which along with clinical manifestations and negative spinocerebellar ataxia gene panel narrowed the diagnosis to NPC. MRI findings showed cortical and midbrain atrophy."
