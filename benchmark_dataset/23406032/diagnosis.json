    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma, metastatic to cervical lymph nodes and the liver.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, primary thyroid lymphoma, metastatic tumors, reactive or lymphoproliferative disorders.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on imaging studies showing hypoechoic nodules with microcalcifications and enlarged lymph nodes suggestive of metastases. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed cells highly suspicious for papillary carcinoma, but histopathological analysis ultimately confirmed medullary thyroid carcinoma with metastatic involvement of lymph nodes and liver."
