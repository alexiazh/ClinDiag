        "differential_diagnosis": [
            "Absence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide methemoglobin-converting enzyme",
            "Absence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, or pyruvate oxidase",

        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acatalasemia was confirmed through observation of markedly decreased erythrocyte catalase activity and the patient's response to hydrogen peroxide, which caused methemoglobinemia in the absence of normal catalase function. The family history indicated that the mother had hypocatalasemia, suggesting a genetic predisposition."
