        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on identifying a novel mutation (C42R) in the KCNJ11 gene through genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene sequencing. The mutation's functional significance was confirmed by physiological analysis, which demonstrated increased spontaneous open probability and reduced ATP sensitivity of the mutated channel. The phenotypes observed in the family members were consistent with this genetic mutation."
