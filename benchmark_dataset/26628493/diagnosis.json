        "final_diagnosis": "POEMS syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, toxic neuropathies, nutritional deficiency-related neuropathies, neuro-sarcoidosis, paraneoplastic etiology, amyloid neuropathy, neuromuscular junction disorders, common muscle disorders",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited progressive symmetrical distal lower limb weakness with electrophysiologic evidence suggesting a progressive axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. CSF analysis indicated an inflammatory cause. Imaging of the spine revealed an expansile lesion at T7, which upon biopsy confirmed a solitary T7 plasmacytoma. The combination of these findings allowed for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome, characterized by a plasma cell neoplasia."
