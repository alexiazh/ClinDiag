        "final_diagnosis": "Iodide transport defect (ITD)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of ITD was supported by the presence of symptomatic congenital hypothyroidism in a newborn with a large goiter, confirmed by thyroid scintigraphy showing no radioiodide uptake (0%). Molecular analysis revealed a homozygous mutation R124H in the NIS gene, which was associated with the complete lack of iodide uptake in vitro. Clinical features included TSH elevation, prolonged jaundice, and marked thyroid enlargement, leading to the conclusion of ITD as the underlying cause of hypothyroidism."
