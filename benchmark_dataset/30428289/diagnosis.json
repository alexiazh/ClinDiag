    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative metastatic breast cancer of the lobular type, with ESR1 mutations",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by histological examination of the biopsy specimens from the sacrum, which revealed dyshesive tumor cells with expression of cytokeratin, mammaglobin, and estrogen and progesterone receptors, consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma of the lobular type. The patient's history of ER-positive lobular carcinoma and imaging findings of bony metastases further supported the diagnosis of a recurrent and metastatic disease."
