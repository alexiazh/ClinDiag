        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of brainstem AVM was established through brain MR imaging revealing a mesencephalic AVM with dilation of the vein of Galen. Further confirmation came from cerebral angiography indicating a large mesencephalic AVM (Spetzlerâ€“Martin Grade 4). After ligation of the PDV, imaging studies showed complete resolution of the brainstem AVM, indicating a correlation between the two vascular conditions."
