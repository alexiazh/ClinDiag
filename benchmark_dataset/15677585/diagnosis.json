        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The abdominal CT demonstrated a free-floating mass consistent with something ingested, and findings suggested it's a trichobezoar, formed from hair. Emily exhibited behaviors indicative of hair consumption (trichophagia), linked to her earlier history of chewing on hair, leading to the diagnosis of Rapunzel syndrome. Her mother and sister's hair were also identified in the mass, confirming the source of ingestion."
