        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was established based on the presence of hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia, low calcitriol levels, and normal serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. Additionally, the patient's history of previously normal serum phosphorus levels, along with her symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and bone pain, supported the diagnosis. Other renal phosphate-wasting disorders were considered but ruled out based on these biochemical markers and the absence of a relevant family history."
