        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of chronic recurrent urticarial skin rash, oral mucosal ulcerations, and positive biopsy results for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Laboratory findings including eosinophilia, elevated inflammatory markers, and low complement levels C3 and C4 further contributed to the diagnosis. The positive anti-C1q antibody test also supported the diagnosis."
