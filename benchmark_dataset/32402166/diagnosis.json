        "final_diagnosis": "LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, focal motor seizures, paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis was supported by the patient's presentation of faciobrachial dystonic seizures and the presence of LGI1 antibodies in the serum. Initial symptoms of fatigue and hyponatremia were linked to the autoimmune process, and the characteristic movements observed during the neurology evaluations suggested a connection to LGI1 encephalitis."
