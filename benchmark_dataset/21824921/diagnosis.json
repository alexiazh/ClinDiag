        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The D1275N mutation was identified in a patient with recurrent exertional syncope, atrial flutter, atrial standstill, conduction disease, and sinus node dysfunction. Cardiac sodium current was significantly reduced in the presence of this mutation when studied through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange in mice, correlating with the observed clinical phenotypes."
