        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited a severe anaphylactic reaction to vancomycin, supported by symptoms such as shortness of breath, throat closing, hypoxemia, and diffuse erythema upon administration. A successful graded challenge with dalbavancin confirmed tolerance, ruling out immediate hypersensitivity to dalbavancin."
