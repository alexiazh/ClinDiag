        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) was supported by the presence of recurrent visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognitive functions, parkinsonism features, and confirmatory pathologic findings of diffuse Lewy bodies. Neuroimaging showed bilateral moderate to severe temporal and parietal cortical hypometabolism and basal ganglia hypermetabolism consistent with DLBD and distinct from Alzheimer's disease."
