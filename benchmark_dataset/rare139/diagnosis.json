        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of thiocyanate toxicity was supported by the patient's clinical presentation and progression following ingestion, including the development of sustained wide complex tachycardia, rigidity, low ionized calcium, and improvement following specific treatments. Initial testing revealed elevated salicylate levels, but subsequent testing showed undetectable salicylates, indicating a different etiology for her symptoms."
