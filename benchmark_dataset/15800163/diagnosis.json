        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of a deficit of the heterozygous 357del4 multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 gene on exon 2 chromosome 11q. The presence of a nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma and a microadenoma of the anterior pituitary gland, along with elevated serum parathyroid hormone after surgery, led to the suspicion and confirmation of MEN 1."
