        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of RTH was based on the presence of persistently elevated serum free T4 and free T3 levels without TSH suppression, along with the identification of a TR/H9252 gene mutation (A317T) in the patient. This supports the diagnosis consistent with the known features of the syndrome."
