        "differential_diagnosis": "LA myxoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of left atrial fibroma was supported by imaging studies (conventional echocardiograms and cardiac computed tomography) that revealed a left atrial mass. Surgical inspection and multiple echo-guided biopsies confirmed the mass as a benign cardiac fibroma, differentiating it from the initially presumed diagnosis of LA myxoma due to its mass characteristics and attachment."
