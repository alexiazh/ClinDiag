        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of central isolated hypothyroidism was confirmed based on extremely low levels of free T3, free T4, and basal TSH in the affected children, and a TRH stimulation test that failed to increase serum TSH levels while normalizing prolactin levels. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous mutation (Q49X) in the TSH- /H9252 subunit gene leading to defects in TSH secretion."
