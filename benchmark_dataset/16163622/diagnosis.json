        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with lymphadenopathy and night sweats, along with severely low CD4 cell counts. An excisional lymph node biopsy showed a polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate with normal architecture, supporting the presence of EBV-related lymphoid hyperplasia without evidence of malignancy. His EBV DNA load and serological tests for EBV antibodies also supported the diagnosis."
