        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Neonatal TSH screening was inconspicuous; at the age of 4 months, the patient presented clinical features of severe congenital hypothyroidism with low TSH, fT3, and undetectable fT4 levels despite normal neonatal TSH screening. The diagnosis was corroborated by genetic testing revealing homozygosity for the 313/H9004T mutation, which is associated with isolated TSH deficiency."
