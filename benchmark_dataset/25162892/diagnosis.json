    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Microcephaly; inborn errors of metabolism; cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by clinical findings of microcephaly, hypomyelination, and elevated homocysteine levels. Genetic testing confirmed mutations in the MTHFR gene. The patient displayed typical symptoms of MTHFR deficiency, including episodes of apnea and central respiratory distress, exacerbated by thrombosis."
