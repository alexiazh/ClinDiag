        "final_diagnosis": "Thoracic radicular pain caused by Tarlov (perineurial) cysts.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Postherpetic neuralgia, diabetes, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, spinal dural arteriovenous fistula or malformation, degenerative spondylosis, perineurial cysts, nerve-sheath tumors.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patientâ€™s long-standing left thoracic pain persisted despite previous evaluations showing no other causes. Imaging revealed multiple Tarlov cysts that corresponded to the pain, with no evidence of compressive lesions or other abnormalities. Postherpetic neuralgia was considered but ruled out due to lack of history. Other differential diagnoses were disregarded due to the location and characteristics of the cysts."
