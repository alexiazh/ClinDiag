        "differential_diagnosis": "Acute pancreatitis; Pyelonephritis; Musculoskeletal pain; Ovarian torsion; Preterm labor",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's elevated serum calcium level and inappropriately normal intact PTH suggested primary hyperparathyroidism. Pancreatitis was likely caused by this hypercalcemia. Despite the normal PTH, high calcium levels, and lab results, the clinical presentation of abdominal and back pain led to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis."
