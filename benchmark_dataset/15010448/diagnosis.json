        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mrs. C has a 23-year history of renal insufficiency with a previous diagnosis of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. Despite initial clinical expectations that she would require dialysis two years ago, her condition has been stable, suggesting a slower progression of kidney disease. Current laboratory results indicate significant renal impairment (creatinine 7.9 mg/dL, estimated GFR approximately 6 mL/1.73m2), supporting the need for renal replacement therapy."
