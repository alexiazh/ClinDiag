        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of MODY5 was supported by the presence of diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, chronic renal failure, and renal morphological abnormalities in the proband, along with genetic testing that identified a heterozygous duplication of exon 5 of the TCF2 gene. This duplication correlated with the clinical phenotypes observed among family members."
