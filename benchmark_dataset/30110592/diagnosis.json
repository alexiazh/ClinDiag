        "final_diagnosis": "Aortocoronary saphenous-veinâ€“graft aneurysm",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Cardiac arrhythmia, reflex syncope, orthostatic hypotension",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with syncope following heavy alcohol use. Clinical evaluation revealed dizziness, hypotension, and an echocardiogram showing two external masses compressing the heart. Cardiac MRI confirmed the diagnosis of two aneurysmal segments of the saphenous-vein graft, suggesting mechanical compression as the cause of syncope."
