        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Histopathologic examination showed Acanthamoeba cysts in the cornea with evidence of chronic chorioretinal inflammation, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and diffuse neuroretinal ischemia. Retinal artery thrombosis was present in several eyes, but there were no amebic cysts or trophozoites in the posterior segment, indicating the inflammation was sterile and likely not due to infectious causes."
