        "final_diagnosis": "Homozygous R262Q mutation in the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor with subsequent borderline oligospermia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A homozygous mutation in the GnRH receptor was identified in two brothers, with one presenting at 15 years of age with delayed puberty. After testosterone treatment, the proband's puberty progressed normally, whereas the younger brother showed minimal progress. The clinical findings, including detectable but apulsatile LH and FSH release, were consistent with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), necessitating ongoing testosterone replacement. The mutation's effect on gonadotropin signaling elucidated the need for clinical vigilance for delayed puberty and its potential complications."
