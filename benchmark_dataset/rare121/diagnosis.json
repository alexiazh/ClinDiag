        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Fibroblastic rheumatism was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of multiple soft, non-tender nodules, morning stiffness, and painful swelling of joints, alongside the MRI findings of synovitis and tenosynovitis. Laboratory tests and imaging did not indicate any other inflammatory or malignant conditions, and the patient's symptoms improved with corticosteroid treatment even though the nodules remained stable."
