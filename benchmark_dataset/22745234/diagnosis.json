    "final_diagnosis": "Huntington's disease with hyperglycemic chorea-ballism in type 1 diabetes mellitus",
    "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
    "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited severe involuntary movements and was diagnosed with DKA and hyperglycemic chorea-ballism. Brain MRI revealed atrophy of the caudate nucleus characteristic of Huntington's disease, and DNA analysis confirmed HD. Recovery from involuntary movements following treatment supported the diagnosis of hyperglycemic chorea-ballism exacerbated by underlying Huntington's disease."
