        "final_diagnosis": "Buerger's Disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient, a 36-year-old man with a significant smoking history, presented with delayed wound healing and evidence of poor blood flow as indicated by the non-palpable dorsalis pedis artery and abnormal findings in angiography. The abrupt occlusion of arteries along with the patient's history strongly suggests Buerger's Disease."
