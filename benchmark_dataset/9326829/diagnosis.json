        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. A exhibited persistent, urge-driven hair pulling, characterized by significant distress and noticeable hair loss. Her symptoms began in adolescence and were marked by increased tension before pulling and relief following the act, consistent with DSM-IV criteria for trichotillomania. The chronic nature of her condition and its impact on her psychosocial functioning further supported the diagnosis."
