        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of lipolymphedema was supported by the patient's history of severe, long-standing bilateral lower extremity enlargement, minimal epidermal changes, positive Stemmer's sign, and MRI findings consistent with fatty hypertrophy and lymphatic involvement. The failure of compression therapy further suggested the misdiagnosis of lymphedema."
