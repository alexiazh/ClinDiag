        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva was confirmed via transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which showed a rupture with a large shunt and continuous flow between the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva and the right ventricle. Additional support came from cardiac MRI and catheterization findings, which indicated significant cardiac dysfunction, right ventricular dilatation, and large left-to-right shunt."
