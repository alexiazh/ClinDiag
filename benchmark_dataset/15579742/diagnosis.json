        "final_diagnosis": "Oxyphil parathyroid adenoma causing severe primary hyperparathyroidism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Parathyroid carcinoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical presentation of the patients, including very high levels of PTH, severe hypercalcemia, and larger-than-typical adenomas, suggested parathyroid carcinoma. However, pathology confirmed the presence of oxyphil cell adenomas, which are benign. The atypical clinical features and significant elevations in biochemical markers helped to distinguish these cases from benign primary hyperparathyroidism."
