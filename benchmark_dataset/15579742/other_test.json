            "changes_over_time": "Twelve hours postoperatively, serum calcium fell to 5.9 mg/dl and PTH dropped to 8 pg/ml. By four days post-surgery, serum calcium increased to 8.2 mg/dl. Two months post-surgery, serum calcium remained low at 7.4 mg/dl, and PTH at 151 pg/ml. Bone turnover markers were elevated at two months and normalized by eight months postoperatively. Bone mineral density increased dramatically, with cumulative increases of 51% at the lumbar spine and 36% at the total hip by one year post-surgery."
