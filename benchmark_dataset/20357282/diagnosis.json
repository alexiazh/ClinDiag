        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by evidence of muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias associated with glycogen depletion in muscle and abnormal storage material in the heart. Genetic analysis revealed a nonsense mutation in one allele and a missense mutation in the other allele of the GYG1 gene, leading to inactivation of glycogenin-1, which is essential for glycogen synthesis."
