        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a 10-year history of cocaine use, which included frequent snorting leading to nasal and palatal ischemia. Physical examination revealed a fistula in the palate and a large septal perforation, both of which are indicative of cocaine abuse. The notable symptoms experienced by the patient, such as hypernasality and food discharge through the nose, further aligned with the diagnosis of midline palate perforation."
