        "final_diagnosis": "Ficolin-3 deficiency associated with homozygous FCN3+1637delC mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had recurrent severe pulmonary infections, brain abscesses, and recurrent warts, and was found to be homozygous for the FCN3+1637delC frameshift mutation. He had undetectable serum levels of ficolin-3 and no complement deposition on acetylated bovine serum albumin, which indicates a complete deficiency in ficolin-3, leading to the diagnosis of ficolin-3 deficiency."
