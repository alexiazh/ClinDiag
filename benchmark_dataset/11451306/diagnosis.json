        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of transient osteoporosis was supported by the clinical presentation of severe groin pain, inability to weight-bear, and imaging findings that showed bone marrow edema in the right femoral head and neck, ruling out other potential serious conditions like fractures or infections. The condition was linked to pregnancy and was noted to be self-limiting, resolving over time."
