        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of FIHP was supported by a novel heterozygous germline mutation found in the MEN1 gene (IVS9/H110011G/H11022A) in affected family members, along with a lack of supportive findings for MEN1 or HPT-JT syndromes, such as normal prolactin and gastrin levels and negative imaging studies."
