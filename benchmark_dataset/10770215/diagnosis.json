        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on the identification of two homozygous missense mutations in the type II 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 betaHSD) gene, leading to different clinical presentations: a nonsalt-wasting phenotype with hyperpigmented scrotum and hypospadias, and a salt-wasting phenotype with male pseudohermaphroditism. Laboratory findings indicated the patients had abnormal serum steroid levels that were consistent with 3 betaHSD deficiency, supporting the diagnosis."
