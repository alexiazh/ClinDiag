    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Temperature-sensitive sodium channelopathy with heat-induced myotonia and cold-induced paralysis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Paramyotonia congenita, Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms included heat-induced myotonia and cold-induced paralysis, with a clear familial occurrence. The identification of a novel mutation (Pro1158Ser) in the SCN4A gene correlated with the bipolar symptoms of myotonia in warmer temperatures and paralysis in colder conditions. Key evidence supporting the diagnosis included serum potassium levels fluctuating with symptoms and the novel mutation's impact on sodium channel functionality."
