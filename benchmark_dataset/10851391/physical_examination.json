            "relevant_findings": "Neurologic examination revealed the patient to be well-built and strong, with no evidence of muscular atrophy; however, muscle power was less than expected. On occasions, the patient was unable to stand upon waking.",
            "changes_over_time": "Initially, the patient experienced muscle weakness that disappeared within several hours. Furthermore, during periods of hypokalemia (potassium levels 2.3 mEq/L), he experienced pronounced weakness; when serum potassium levels increased, grip and eyelid myotonia became apparent without weakness."
