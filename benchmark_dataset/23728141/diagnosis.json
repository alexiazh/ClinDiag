            "WHIM syndrome",
            "idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia",
            "other adult-onset primary immunodeficiency disorders"
        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of MonoMAC syndrome was supported by a constellation of symptoms including peripheral cytopenias, recurrent NTM infections, HPV infections, EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors, and autoimmune phenomena. Genetic testing confirmed a heterozygous mutation in GATA2, which is consistent with the diagnosis of GATA2 deficiency. The presence of profound monocytopenia and B and NK cell lymphopenia, along with characteristic bone marrow findings, further validated the diagnosis."
