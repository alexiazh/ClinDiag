        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of metastatic postpubertal immature teratoma was made based on the patient's history of testicular cancer, the characteristics of the neck mass, imaging results, and pathology findings from the biopsy. The evolution of the mass, its atypical location, and the histological composition associated with mature teratoma indicated a potential late recurrence of the germ-cell tumor."
