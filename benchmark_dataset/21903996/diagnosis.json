        "final_diagnosis": "Severe Recessive Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type 1 (PHA1)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of severe recessive PHA1 was confirmed by genetic testing that identified compound heterozygous mutations (p.Ser166X and p.Trp806X) in the NR3C2 gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor. Biochemical findings included hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and failure to thrive, all indicative of PHA1 despite high plasma renin and aldosterone levels. The patient's extreme sodium requirements and the genetic confirmation of the mutations supported the diagnosis."
