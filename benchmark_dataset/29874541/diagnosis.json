        "final_diagnosis": "Infantile pulmonary teratoid tumor",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Pulmonary blastoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma, pulmonary teratoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The tumor was distinct from pulmonary blastoma and pleuropulmonary blastoma, as no pathogenic DICER1 or CTNNB1 variants were identified. Genetic sequencing indicated similarities with ovarian small-cell carcinoma rather than pulmonary blastomas. The tumor exhibited unique histologic features inconsistent with classic biphasic pulmonary blastoma and had a germline SMARCA4 pathogenic variant."
