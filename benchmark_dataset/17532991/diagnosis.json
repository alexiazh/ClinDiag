        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on enhanced computed tomography findings which showed a round mass in the consolidated right middle lobe that enhanced equally to the pulmonary vessel, indicating a possible pulmonary artery aneurysm secondary to lung suppuration. The presence of granulomatous tissue in the cavitary lesion and the negative results for acid-fast bacillus further supported this diagnosis."
