        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's psychosis was presumed to have been related to her increased serum concentration of efavirenz, supported by the gradual resolution of her symptoms after the discontinuation of efavirenz therapy. Key evidence included a serum efavirenz concentration of 19,013 ng/mL which was 7â€“8 times higher than expected, normal MRI findings, and a heterozygous gene polymorphism (CYP2B6 -516-G/T) affecting efavirenz metabolism."
