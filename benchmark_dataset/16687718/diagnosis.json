        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with normochromic, normocytic anemia, elevated iron levels, and a family history of Diamond–Blackfan anemia. Bone marrow biopsy indicated erythroid hyperplasia with preserved erythropoiesis and an increase in dysplastic forms. Blood tests confirmed increased levels of hemoglobin F and raised erythrocyte adenosine deaminase, which corresponded with family history. Genetic studies revealed mutations consistent with δβ-thalassemia, contributing to the observed hematologic findings."
