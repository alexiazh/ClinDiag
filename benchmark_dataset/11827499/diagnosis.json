        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with recurrent vaginitis and abnormal cervical discharge. Testing confirmed the presence of HIV infection, which is typical in women with recurrent gynecologic infections. The patient's HIV-1 RNA level was high, which, coupled with a low CD4 count, justified the initiation of antiretroviral therapy."
