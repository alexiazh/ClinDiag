        "final_diagnosis": "Primary cutaneous tuberculosis of the penis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Chronic penile ulcer, infectious granulomatous diseases, foreign body reaction, vasculitides, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a painless indurated ulcer on the penis, negative results from various cultures and stains, and ultimately a culture-positive result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the excision biopsy showing caseating granulomas. Molecular typing confirmed the identity and resistance profile of the organism."
