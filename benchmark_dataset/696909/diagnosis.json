        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed bilateral upper limb asterixis after ECT, prompting a search for a metabolic cause. Laboratory tests revealed elevated plasma calcium (12.0 mg/dl) and elevated parathyroid hormone (44 pEq/ml), leading to a presumptive diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Previous calcium levels also suggested a history of this condition."
