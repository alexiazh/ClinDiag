        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva was established based on the pathognomonic findings of congenital malformations of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification in characteristic anatomical patterns. The patient's clinical course exhibited severe progressive heterotopic ossification despite transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from a normal donor, suggesting that the molecular abnormality responsible for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is expressed in non-hematopoietic cells."
