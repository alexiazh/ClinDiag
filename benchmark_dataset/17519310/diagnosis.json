        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of a heterozygous R77C transition mutation in the GH-1 gene, which correlated with short stature and partial GH insensitivity in the affected patient and his family members. Clinical findings included elevated GH levels, low IGF-I levels, and a history of delayed growth and pubertal development."
