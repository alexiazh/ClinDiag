        "final_diagnosis": "Anal fistula",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colonic melanosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of anal fistula was supported by imaging studies revealing extensive inflammation and fistula formation in the rectal and perianal areas. Additionally, the patient's symptoms, including perianal pain and recurrent diarrhea, alongside CT and MRI findings, pointed towards this diagnosis. The biopsy indicated mucinous adenocarcinoma, which is relevant but distinct from the fistula diagnosis."
