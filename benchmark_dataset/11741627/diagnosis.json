        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria was based on the patient's symptoms of vomiting, altered behavior, and family history of alcohol intolerance, leading to a biochemical screen for porphyria. Blood tests indicated elevated white cell count, low serum potassium, and ketonuria, while the biochemical results were consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, including elevated faecal copro-porphyrins and specific patterns in porphyrin levels. The psychiatric manifestations and the history of undiagnosed illness necessitated further investigation to identify treatable organic causes of the patient's symptoms."
