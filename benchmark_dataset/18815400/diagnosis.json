        "final_diagnosis": "Breast cancer with minimal metastatic disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a palpable breast mass and imaging studies revealed a solid mass with characteristics consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, which expressed estrogen and progesterone receptors and did not overexpress HER2/neu. A metastatic lesion in the spine was confirmed through biopsy, indicating breast cancer with oligometastatic disease."
