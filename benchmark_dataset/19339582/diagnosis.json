        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was based on histologic analysis of the resected specimen, which confirmed high-grade osteosarcoma in a patient with Mazabraud syndrome and a prior diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. Initial imaging indicated fibrous dysplasia, but biopsy results showed poorly differentiated malignant cells, leading to further analysis that identified the osteosarcoma."
