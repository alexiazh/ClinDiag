        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with substernal chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG, suggesting an acute myocardial infarction. Given the postpartum status and the nature of the symptoms, coronary-artery dissection was considered likely, particularly as coronary dissections account for a significant proportion of myocardial infarctions in postpartum women. The angiographic findings demonstrated severe narrowing and characteristics consistent with a dissection."
