        "differential_diagnosis": "Hypertensive forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Bartter syndrome, dexamethasone-sensitive mineralocorticoid excess",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of AME was established based on clinical signs of hypokalemic hypertension, suppressed plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and abnormal urinary steroid profiles, notably an increased ratio of cortisol to cortisone. Genetic mutations in the HSD11B2 gene leading to enzyme deficiency were identified. Treatment with MR antagonist spironolactone indicated a response consistent with AME."
