        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a history of recurrent synovial chondromatosis with multiple recurrences that eventually transformed histologically into a grade-2 chondrosarcoma. Postoperative cytogenetic testing demonstrated DNA aneuploidy, which distinguished it from benign cases, indicating the malignant transformation of the initially diagnosed benign condition."
