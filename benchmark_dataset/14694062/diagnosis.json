        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Increased plasma and CSF ACE levels were noted, which suggested neurosarcoidosis; however, the patient showed no evidence of (neuro)sarcoidosis, and an autosomal dominant ACE mutation was identified, indicating hereditary elevation of ACE levels as a possible confounding factor."
