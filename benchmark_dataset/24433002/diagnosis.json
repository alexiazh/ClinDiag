        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe symptoms including hypertension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and bilateral papilledema. Elevated plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, along with imaging studies that identified bilateral adrenal tumors, supported the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The underlying MEN-2a syndrome diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a new-onset RET gene mutation."
