        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PXE was supported by characteristic skin lesions, peau d'orange appearance on funduscopic examination, and biopsy findings showing calcification and fragmentation of elastic fibers in the mid dermis. Family examinations revealed limited phenotypic expression in relatives, indicating a hereditary pattern."
