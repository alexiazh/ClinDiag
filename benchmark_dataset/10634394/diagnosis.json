        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of short stature due to SHOX defects was based on the identification of a complete SHOX deletion in a 15-year-old girl who presented with mild mesomelic shortening of the forearms and lower legs. Genetic analysis of SHOX and clinical evaluations indicated no other underlying endocrine disorders or skeletal diseases. The effective treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for children with SHOX point mutations further corroborated the diagnosis."
