        "final_diagnosis": "Ebola virus disease (EVD)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients tested positive for Ebola virus via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and their clinical presentations and laboratory findings were consistent with EVD. Patient 1 had low Ct values indicating a higher EBOV RNA load and improved symptoms after supportive care. Patient 2's renal failure resolved with careful fluid and electrolyte management, and he also had positive EBOV RT-PCR tests, with clinical signs of improvement and eventual recovery."
