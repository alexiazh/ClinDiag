        "differential_diagnosis": "Lipomatous medulloblastoma, central neurocytoma, ependymoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of cerebellar liponeurocytoma was supported by the presence of a solitary fat-containing tumor seen on CT and MRI, the histopathological analysis showing neuronal, glial, and lipomatous differentiation, immunohistochemical profiles showing positivity for neuronal markers and minimal evidence of anaplastic features. Family history indicated similar tumors in immediate family members, suggesting a possible hereditary predisposition."
