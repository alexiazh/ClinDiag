        "differential_diagnosis": "Primary hyperparathyroidism",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "A novel heterozygous mutation (F180C) in the CASR gene was identified, establishing the basis of the hypercalcemia. Despite severely elevated PTH levels which initially suggested primary hyperparathyroidism, low calcium to creatinine clearance ratio and family history necessitated the consideration of FHH. Vitamin D deficiency was confirmed, influencing the clinical severity."
