        "differential_diagnosis": "Loeys–Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) was achieved based on the patient's clinical features, family history of ATS, and genetic mapping that revealed a mutation in the SLC2A10 gene. The patient exhibited notable dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, leading to moderate aortic valve incompetence as supported by echocardiographic and angiographic findings."
