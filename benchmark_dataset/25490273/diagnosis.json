        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin was strongly positive in the tumor, supporting the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer, despite undetectable serum calcitonin levels preoperatively. The histopathology confirmed a 2.6 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm MTC with minimal capsular invasion. The rarity of calcitonin-negative medullary thyroid cancer and the presence of strong immunostaining indicated a unique case."
