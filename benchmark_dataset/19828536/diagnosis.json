        "final_diagnosis": "Hermanskyâ€“Pudlak syndrome with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, sarcoidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with clinical features consistent with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, including oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and severe pulmonary fibrosis evident from imaging studies. The presence of ground-glass opacities and architectural distortion, along with the patient's ethnic background and family history of albinism, supported the diagnosis. Other conditions were considered but lacked some pivotal supporting findings, such as the characteristically associated features of the other interstitial lung diseases."
