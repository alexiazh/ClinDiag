        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of MERS-CoV was confirmed based on the patient's recent travel to Saudi Arabia, symptoms including fatigue, low-grade fever, and respiratory distress, as well as positive rRT-PCR tests for MERS-CoV from serum and sputum samples. The initial negative nasopharyngeal swab contrasted with the positive results from the serum and sputum, which is noted to occur in MERS-CoV cases. The genomic analysis showed a high similarity with known MERS-CoV sequences from the region."
