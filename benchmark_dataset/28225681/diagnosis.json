        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was supported by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the temporal artery primarily composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, with a significant number of IgG4+ plasma cells. Other supporting features included polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hypocomplementemia, and the presence of eosinophilia. Previous biopsies revealed features consistent with autoimmune hepatitis and multicentric Castleman’s disease but were predominantly and characteristically indicative of IgG4-related disease."
