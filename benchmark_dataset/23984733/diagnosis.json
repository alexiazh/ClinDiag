        "final_diagnosis": "autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) due to a germline FAS mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Evans syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The initial presentation included isolated thrombocytopenia and later developed into trilineage cytopenias. Bone marrow aspiration ruled out neoplastic processes, leading to suspicion of an autoimmune disorder. Flow cytometry revealed elevated levels of double-negative T cells, along with a FAS receptor mutation identified through genetic testing, confirming the diagnosis of ALPS."
