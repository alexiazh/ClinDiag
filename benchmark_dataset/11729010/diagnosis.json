        "final_diagnosis": "Advanced Huntingtonâ€™s disease with severe behavioral disturbances",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Delirium, psychotic affective syndrome, mania, dementia (distinguished from delirium)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's complex behavioral disturbances, including aggression, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment, were noted as likely exacerbated by polypharmacy and delirium. However, his symptoms were primarily attributed to advanced Huntington's disease, supported by a history of progressive motor symptoms and psychiatric issues. Imaging results indicated atrophy consistent with Huntington's disease, and the patient's decline in cognitive function further corroborated this diagnosis."
