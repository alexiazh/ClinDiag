        "differential_diagnosis": "Emphysematous obstructive lung disease, postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans, primary lung diseases, childhood interstitial lung diseases, immunodeficiency syndromes, autoimmune disorders, connective-tissue disorders",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included severe emphysematous obstructive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, aortic regurgitation, and joint hypermobility. The initial suspicion of several conditions, including connective-tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, was considered. Genetic testing confirmed a heterozygous mutation in the FLNA gene, which links to the respiratory phenotype observed. This mutation is associated with a unique presentation of lung disease in the context of congenital cardiac anomalies and connective-tissue features."
