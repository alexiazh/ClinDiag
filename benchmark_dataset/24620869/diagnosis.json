    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV of IV, involving the leptomeninges and consistent with primary leptomeningeal gliomatosis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, coccidioidal meningitis, neoplastic meningitis, hypertrophic pachymeningitis.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with chronic meningitis symptoms, but later imaging revealed a mass in the left frontal lobe and subsequent biopsy showed glioblastoma. The CSF profile indicated high protein levels with low glucose, typical of severe chronic meningitis, which led to consideration of both infectious and non-infectious causes. The patient's demographics and symptomatology suggested a possibility of tuberculous meningitis, but ultimately, the mass was diagnosed as glioblastoma, suggesting primary leptomeningeal gliomatosis may have been the underlying issue."
