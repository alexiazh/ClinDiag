        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on a combination of episodic neuroglycopenic hypoglycemia, elevated insulin and proinsulin levels detected during a supervised fasting test, and subsequent imaging and intra-arterial calcium stimulation tests that indicated pancreatic lesions, ultimately confirmed by pathology showing multiple subcentimeter insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors."
