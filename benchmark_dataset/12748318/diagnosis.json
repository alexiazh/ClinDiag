        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with waxing and waning pulmonary nodules, a history of seminoma, and no evidence of a malignant process on imaging or biopsies. The combination of a history of gastroesophageal reflux and the nature of the lung lesions suggested bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration."
