        "final_diagnosis": "metastatic breast carcinoma with secondary adrenal insufficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Sjögren’s syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, diabetes insipidus, lymphoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of weakness, intermittent nausea, orthostasis, and polydipsia were considered in light of diffuse lymphadenopathy and her history of autoimmune conditions. Initial findings of hyponatremia and signs of hypopituitarism raised concern for an underlying malignancy. Further testing and imaging revealed a mass in the hypothalamic region and subsequent biopsy confirmed breast carcinoma. The adrenal insufficiency was indicated by low baseline cortisol levels and a positive stimulation test response."
