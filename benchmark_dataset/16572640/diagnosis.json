        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of congenital factor X deficiency was made based on the child's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which were markedly abnormal, showing PT greater than 160 seconds and aPTT greater than 200 seconds. Coagulation studies revealed a specific factor deficiency with factor X levels at 1.5% of normal. The presence of a hematoma indicated significant coagulopathy and guided further testing that confirmed the deficiency of factor X, with a genetic mutation present in both the child and his parents."
