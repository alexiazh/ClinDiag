        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms, including confusion, blurry vision, vertigo, ataxia, and memory impairment, developed abruptly, consistent with Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Key findings included impaired lateral gaze, nystagmus, and ataxia, alongside low thiamine levels, all supporting the diagnosis of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. The patient's history of gastric bypass surgery and associated nutritional deficiencies further substantiated this diagnosis."
