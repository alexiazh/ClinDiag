        "final_diagnosis": "autoimmune hepatitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, acute biliary obstruction",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with severe liver injury indicated by markedly elevated aminotransferase levels, with more modest elevations of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. The pattern of liver enzyme elevation is consistent with hepatocellular injury. Given the history of normal liver function tests previously, autoimmune hepatitis was considered due to the presence of chronic lobular hepatitis features in the liver biopsy, along with substantial fibrosis indicating chronicity. The absence of relevant viral infections and a potential link to medication also supported this diagnosis."
