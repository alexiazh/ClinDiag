        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by imaging findings showing lytic lesions in the hip and kidney, serum inflammatory markers indicating elevated levels, and a biopsy confirming blastomycosis. There was a lack of response to initial treatment for iliotibial band syndrome, leading to further investigation."
