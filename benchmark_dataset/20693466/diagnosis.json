        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of bipolar I disorder was confirmed through a history of severe mood episodes, including mixed mania and depression. The complexity of treatment was magnified by the patient's desire to conceive while managing her psychiatric condition effectively. The need for polypharmacy and careful monitoring during pregnancy underscored the severity and refractory nature of her bipolar disorder."
