        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of fever, hepatic dysfunction, pancytopenia, and negative cultures for other infections, along with the findings of well-formed noncaseating granulomas in bone marrow and lung biopsies, were strongly suggestive of disseminated histoplasmosis. Blood cultures eventually confirmed the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum, which aligned with the patient's clinical presentation."
