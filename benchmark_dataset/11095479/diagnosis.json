        "final_diagnosis": "Familial Splenomegaly: Sea-Blue Histiocytosis associated with Apolipoprotein E Mutation (apoE D149 Leu)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Cholesterol ester storage disease, Niemann-Pick variant, Gaucher disease, severe hypertriglyceridemia, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency, Tangier disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both probands exhibited splenomegaly with sea-blue histiocytes but normal or mildly elevated serum triglyceride levels. A genetic mutation (3-bp deletion) in the apoE gene (resulting in apoE D149 Leu) was identified and linked to the observed lipid metabolism derangement and splenomegaly, which increased post-splenectomy."
