        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The boy presented with diffuse osteopenia and multiple compression fractures. Imaging studies indicated prolonged demineralization, and the uniform MRI signal suggested a long-standing process. Laboratory findings included a low white-cell count with elevated lymphocytes, mild anemia, and slight cervical lymphadenopathy, which aligned with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the presence of leukemic cells, leading to the treatment and diagnosis."
