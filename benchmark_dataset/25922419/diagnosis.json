        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of long QT syndrome (LQTS) was supported by whole exome sequencing revealing a homozygous TRDN-encoded triadin frame-shift mutation in a patient presenting with recurrent exertion-induced syncope/cardiac arrest, QTc prolongation, and extensive T-wave inversions in precordial leads. The clinical features were consistent across multiple patients with similar mutations."
