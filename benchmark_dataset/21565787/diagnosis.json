    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Iodide transport defect (ITD) due to a novel mutation in the Na/I symporter (NIS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of iodide transport defect was supported by the presence of a novel homozygous C to T transition mutation in the 5' untranslated region of the NIS gene, which was associated with a significant decrease in iodide uptake in functional studies. Serum TSH levels were elevated, and thyroid scintigraphy showed reduced radioiodine uptake, consistent with ITD."
