        "final_diagnosis": "Primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PNE was supported by the child's persistent bedwetting episodes without arousal upon bladder distension. The presence of NDI was confirmed through biochemical evaluation during thirst trials, indicating unchanged urinary osmolalities despite desmopressin treatment. Administration of desmopressin relieved PNE symptoms, converting them into nocturia, suggesting a non-reliance on the renal V2 receptor for the therapeutic effect."
