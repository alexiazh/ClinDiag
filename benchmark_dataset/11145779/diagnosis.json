        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of GHB overdose was made based on the patient's history of recreational drug use, clinical presentation of coma, apnea, bradycardia, and the lack of response to naloxone. Subsequent improvement in the Glasgow Coma Scale after administration of physostigmine supported the diagnosis."
