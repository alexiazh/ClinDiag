        "differential_diagnosis": [
            "coronary artery disease causing myocardial ischemia",
            "left ventricular outflow tract obstruction",
            "new-onset left ventricular systolic dysfunction"
        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of prior aortic valve surgery and the presence of exertional dyspnea and angina led to suspicion of bioprosthetic aortic valve dysfunction. Echocardiography confirmed severe stenosis with elevated gradients, supporting the diagnosis. Further investigations ruled out other potential causes of symptom exacerbation, such as metabolic, infectious, thrombotic, and autoimmune diseases."
