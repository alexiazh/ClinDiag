        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. D, a healthy 36-year-old woman, was evaluated as a potential kidney donor for her mother, who has end-stage renal disease. She met criteria for donation but was advised to lose weight to achieve a BMI between 24 and 27 and to quit smoking. There were no abnormalities in her blood and urine tests, and she had normal renal function. Her mother's medical history and familial risk factors were considered in assessing Ms. Dâ€™s eligibility for donation."
