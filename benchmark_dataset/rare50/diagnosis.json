        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of vaginal atresia was supported by the clinical presentation of primary amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain, and physical examination findings of obstructed vaginal mucosa with distension. Imaging studies, including the pelvic ultrasound and MRI, confirmed hematometrocolpos and distension of the vaginal cavity, which indicated an obstruction consistent with vaginal atresia."
