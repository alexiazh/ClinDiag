        "differential_diagnosis": "Neurofibromatosis type 1, Lynch syndrome, Fanconi’s anemia, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Carney complex",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CMMR-D syndrome was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis showing a complete absence of PMS2 in both the tumor and normal tissue, indicative of a constitutional absence of PMS2 protein. Genetic testing identified biallelic mutations in PMS2, confirming the diagnosis of CMMR-D syndrome."
