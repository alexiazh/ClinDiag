        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with hypotension, anemia, and a cyanotic flap suggesting ischemia. Despite treatment for his hypotension and anemia, flap appearance did not improve. Further evaluation showed brisk bleeding upon needle insertion into the flap, leading to the conclusion of a venous outflow obstruction. Systemic hypoperfusion likely contributed, and tensions at inset, along with potential compression issues, were also considered."
