The remaining glomeruli showed subtle changes with mild increase in mesangial cellularity and matrix, and focal thickening of capillary walls. Electron microscopy revealed widespread mesangial expansion by fibrillar collagen, normal capillary walls in many loops, but with expansion of capillary walls by subendothelial electron dense material and areas of duplication of the lamina densa.",
