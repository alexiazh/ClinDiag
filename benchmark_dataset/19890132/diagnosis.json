        "final_diagnosis": "acquired von Willebrand's disease",
        "differential_diagnosis": "deficiency of factor VIII, IX, or XI; inhibitor of factor VIII, IX, or XI; unfractionated heparin; direct thrombin inhibitors",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with prolonged bleeding at the site of oral surgery, prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) and normal platelet count. These findings indicate a disorder of primary hemostasis. The presence of low levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, along with the absence of prior abnormal bleeding, suggests an acquired rather than congenital disorder, leading to the diagnosis of acquired von Willebrandâ€™s disease."
