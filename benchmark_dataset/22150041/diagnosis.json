        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Neuroendocrine-cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) was supported by the child presenting with persistent respiratory distress, having fine crackles, and demonstrating radiographic hyperinflation without major respiratory parenchymal infiltration. The findings on the lung biopsy also showed increased neuroendocrine cells which are characteristic of NEHI. Other possible conditions were considered but were ruled out based on clinical and imaging evidence."
