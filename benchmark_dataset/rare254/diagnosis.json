        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) was based on the patient's clinical presentation, which included a congenital deformity of the lower lip, a history of recurrent inflammation in that area, and the excretion of a saliva-like mucous secretion through the orifices of the lower lip. The presence of bilateral pits in the vermilion of the lower lip and intraoperative findings matching known characteristics of VWS further supported the diagnosis. A histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of a tract lined by squamous epithelium with minor salivary glandular tissue."
