        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of sitosterolemia was supported by increased sitosterol levels of 71.7 μg/mL, compared to the normal range of 0.5 to 5.0 μg/mL. Additionally, genetic analyses confirmed the presence of homozygous ABCG5 mutations. The clinical presentation included xanthomas and arthralgia, which aligned with sitosterolemia symptoms."
