        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established following exome-sequencing revealing a homozygous missense mutation (p.Leu597Ser) in the SLC26A4 gene in a patient with thyroid hypoplasia. Further validation and screening in a cohort of 94 patients with thyroid dysgenesis identified another case with a homozygous mutation (p.Gln413Arg). These mutations are associated with Pendred syndrome and suggest a genetic contribution to structural thyroid defects previously unexplained by known candidate genes."
