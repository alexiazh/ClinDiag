        "final_diagnosis": "Isolated Hypoparathyroidism due to Heterozygous Mutations in TBX1",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The identification of splice-altering mutations (c.1009+1G>C and c.1009+2T>C) in TBX1, confirmed through whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing, along with the clinical presentation of affected family members, provided evidence for the genetic etiology of isolated hypoparathyroidism. The presence of low or inappropriately normal PTH levels in affected individuals supported the diagnosis."
