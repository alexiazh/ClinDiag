        "differential_diagnosis": "Delirium, substance use disorder (heroin and cocaine), depression",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. C developed psychotic mania shortly after starting pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C, suggesting a temporal link. His previous history of depression was ruled out as a precipitating factor for the mania since it had occurred several months prior and the fluoxetine dose increase occurred earlier. Delirium was deemed unlikely due to his sustained alertness, and substance use was excluded by history and testing. Therefore, it was concluded that the manic episode was induced by treatment with interferon."
