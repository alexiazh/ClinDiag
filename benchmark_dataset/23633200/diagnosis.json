        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The proband exhibited symptoms consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, including high serum levels of TSH and free T4, with genetic analyses confirming a heterozygous mutation in the THRB gene. In addition, other family members presented varying thyroid function test results that corresponded with known genetic deficiencies, supporting the diagnosis of both RTH and TBG-CD."
