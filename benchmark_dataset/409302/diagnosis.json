        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients exhibited involuntary movements such as axial dystonia and facial grimacing following treatment with antipsychotic medications. The onset of psychiatric symptoms occurred during young adulthood, and the severity of the dyskinesia was linked to long-term exposure to these medications. Treatment with haloperidol led to a prompt reduction of symptoms, supporting the diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia."
