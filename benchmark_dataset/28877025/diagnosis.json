    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with neurolymphomatosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "malignant nerve-root infiltration, potentially from breast cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma; paraneoplastic syndrome; autoimmune conditions including chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), vasculitis; infectious causes such as Lyme disease or CMV infection; metabolic conditions.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The combination of asymmetric facial and limb weakness, significant weight loss, and the presence of multiple vascular masses along with nerve conduction studies indicating denervation suggested a malignant process. Ultimately, pathological testing confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly with the finding of a clonal B-cell population, despite negative initial cytologic tests and the delay in diagnosis due to misinterpretation of the ovarian masses."
