        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The differential diagnosis includes neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes. Neoplastic considerations were prioritized due to the imaging findings of abnormal enhancement, restricted diffusion, and increased relative cerebral blood volume, which strongly suggest primary CNS lymphoma. The absence of intratumoral susceptibility signals and the infiltrative appearance further support this diagnosis. Non-neoplastic causes are deemed less likely based on the diffusion and perfusion imaging results."
