        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) was supported by the patient's family history of HHT and characteristic cutaneous telangiectasia. Imaging, including spinal MR and subsequent angiography, revealed a large macro-arteriovenous fistula (MA VF) in the thoracic spinal canal causing venous varix and surrounding spinal cord edema, indicating a high risk for neurological deficits."
