        "final_diagnosis": "Subacute thyroiditis (SAT)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of SAT was based on clinical presentation including fever, neck pain radiating to the jaw, and palpitations 15 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. Laboratory findings showed elevated FT4 and FT3, undetectable TSH, increased inflammatory markers, and a thyroid ultrasound revealing bilateral diffuse hypoechoic areas. These findings, along with a previous normal thyroid evaluation, confirmed SAT."
