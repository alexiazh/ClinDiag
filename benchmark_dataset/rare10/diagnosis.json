        "final_diagnosis": "Progressive osseous heteroplasia",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of progressive osseous heteroplasia was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of generalized calcific nodules, progressive contractures, and muscle weakness, along with a negative electromyography. The skeletal survey revealed extensive heterotopic ossification in soft tissues and muscles, while genetic testing identified a novel de novo pathogenic variant in the FAM111B gene. These findings align with the characteristics of progressive osseous heteroplasia."
