        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited a broad range of serological cross-reactivity with antibodies to Coxiella burnetii and Bartonella species. The serological confirmation of high levels of antibodies against C. burnetii phases I and II, along with negative cultures, and the clinical manifestations supporting the diagnosis of Q fever endocarditis led to the final diagnosis."
