        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included rapid cognitive decline, insomnia, confusion, cerebellar ataxia, and myoclonus, which were indicative of a progressive central nervous system disorder. Imaging studies showed volume loss and abnormal diffusion in critical areas of the brain. The diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease was supported by the serial changes in clinical symptoms and negative results for other potential diseases. Factors such as age at onset and the clinical course also correlated with typical presentations of prion diseases."
