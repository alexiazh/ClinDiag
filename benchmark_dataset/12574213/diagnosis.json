        "final_diagnosis": "Atypical Bartter Syndrome with Sensorineural Deafness (BSND) with G47R Mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Infantile Bartter Syndrome, Classic Bartter Syndrome, Gitelman Syndrome, Renal Tubular Acidosis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of atypical BSND was supported by the identification of the G47R mutation in the BSND gene, along with clinical features such as congenital deafness, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypokalemia. The absence of classic symptoms typically seen in IBS and the patient's milder manifestation of symptoms compared to typical BSND cases suggest a new subgroup within Bartter syndrome. Key findings included normal birth circumstances, lack of marked fetal polyhydramnios, and unusual characteristics aligning more closely with classic Bartter syndrome, except for the presence of deafness."
