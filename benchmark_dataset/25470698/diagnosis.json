        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms including peripheral neuropathy characterized by pain and paresthesias. Key findings included a history of homelessness, IV drug use, HCV infection, and anemia. Despite negative tests for HIV, cryoglobulinemia, and other common causes, the appearance of dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea suggested niacin deficiency (pellagra), further supported by undetectable serum niacin levels. Treatment with niacin led to resolution of many symptoms, although advanced neuropathy persisted, indicating a nutritional deficiency was a significant contributing factor."
