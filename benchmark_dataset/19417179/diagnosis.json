        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. D's prostate cancer, diagnosed incidentally, was based on an elevated PSA level of 5.3 ng/mL, with a pathology report showing adenocarcinoma in the right mid apex involving 10% of a single biopsy core. This, along with a Gleason score of 6 and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia found in two other cores, supported the diagnosis of localized prostate cancer. Mr. D exhibited no significant urinary obstructive symptoms, and given the low-risk profile of his cancer, active surveillance was recommended."
