        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The documented case involved a 67-year-old man diagnosed with multiple heterogeneous gastrointestinal tumors, revealing a germline PDGFRA mutation (P653L). Key findings included the presence of gastric GISTs and inflammatory fibroid polyps. The analysis of family history indicated multiple members with gastrointestinal tumors, supporting the hereditary nature of the condition. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluations, alongside sequence analysis, confirmed the diagnosis of PDGFRA-mutant syndrome."
