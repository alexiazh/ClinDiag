        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, exacerbated by her complex medical history including a recent double-unit cord-blood transplantation. The presence of upper respiratory symptoms, diffuse ground-glass opacities, and clinical deterioration suggested a viral pneumonia. Testing confirmed adenovirus infection following positive antigen tests from respiratory specimens and a high level of adenovirus viremia. Other potential diagnoses were considered based on the patient's immunocompromised state and history but tested negative or were ruled out."
