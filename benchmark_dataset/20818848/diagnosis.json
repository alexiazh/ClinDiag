        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's symptoms, including a penile ulcer, a papulosquamous rash, optic neuritis, and a positive serum rapid plasma reagin test. The high erythrocyte sedimentation rate raised the possibility of secondary syphilis with central nervous system involvement, particularly given the ocular manifestations. Follow-up tests confirmed the diagnosis of secondary syphilis with cerebellar and optic nerve involvement."
