        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 6-year history of severe pruritus without any skin rash. After excluding other diseases associated with itching, an elimination diet free of food additives was initiated, which resulted in a significant reduction in pruritus. Double-blind placebo-controlled challenges confirmed that sodium benzoate induced pruritus, leading to the diagnosis of sodium benzoate intolerance."
