        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Jacobsen Syndrome was supported by the detection of a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q24q25) through chromosome analysis and further confirmed by a 9-Mb deletion identified by array-CGH. The findings were consistent with the patient's clinical presentation, including congenital heart disease and developmental milestones."
