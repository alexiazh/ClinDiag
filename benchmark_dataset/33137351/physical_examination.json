Five months later, recorded acuity was 20/30 bilaterally. The proband from Family 2, a 43-year-old male, had bilateral visual acuity of 20/17 with hyperpigmented lines radiating from the fovea, and 18 years later, visual acuities were 20/60 (right) and 20/30 (left). The proband from Family 3, a 27-year-old woman, had visual acuity of 20/20 bilaterally with macular pigmentary changes, which were unchanged 21 months later. The proband from Family 4, a 32-year-old woman, had visual acuities of 20/30 (right) and 20/17 (left), which remained unchanged after 10 months. The proband from Family 5, a 31-year-old woman, had visual acuity of 20/20 and peripheral retinal pigmentary changes, which were 20/17 bilaterally four years later. The proband from Family 6, a 62-year-old male, had diminished visual acuities of 20/125 (right) and 20/30 (left), diagnosed with macular pattern dystrophy; at age 79, acuities were 20/80 (right) and 20/200 (left) with marked macular atrophy.",

The proband from Family 2's acuity decreased from 20/17 bilaterally to 20/60 (right) and 20/30 (left) over 18 years. The proband from Family 3's acuity remained unchanged after 21 months. The proband from Family 4's acuities remained unchanged after 10 months. The proband from Family 5's acuity improved from 20/20 to 20/17 bilaterally over four years. The proband from Family 6 experienced a decline in visual acuity from 20/125 (right) and 20/30 (left) to 20/80 (right) and 20/200 (left) over 17 years."
