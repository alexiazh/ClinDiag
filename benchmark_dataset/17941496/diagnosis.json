        "final_diagnosis": "Multiple vertebral hemangiomas associated with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Metastatic invasion of the spine",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of multiple vertebral hemangiomas was confirmed by angiographic studies showing vascularized lesions at multiple vertebral levels, and histopathological examination revealed abnormal vessels consistent with benign hemangiomas. The patient's history of severe paraparesis and the presence of a germline PTEN mutation further supported the diagnosis."
