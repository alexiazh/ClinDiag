        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical triad of erythema nodosum, polyarthralgia, and hilar lymphadenopathy, along with a positive PPD test and the patient's symptom resolution during corticosteroid therapy, strongly suggested a tuberculosis-related process. Negative serial sputum tests for acid-fast bacilli and no evidence of active tuberculosis compared to the presentations typical of other conditions in the differential, reinforced the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis."
