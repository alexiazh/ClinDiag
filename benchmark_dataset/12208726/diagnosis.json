        "final_diagnosis": "von Hippel-Lindau syndrome with optic nerve head hemangioblastoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited reduced visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and a marked reduction in visual field due to optic nerve head hemangioblastoma, which rapidly improved following treatment with the VEGF receptor inhibitor SU5416. The improvement in visual function parameters, alongside the absence of change in lesion size, suggests that inhibition of VEGF may have addressed vascular permeability extensively contributing to visual function restoration."
