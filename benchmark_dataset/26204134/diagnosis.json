    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Iodide transport defect (ITD) with severe hypothyroidism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient was diagnosed with ITD based on elevated TSH levels, low iodide uptake in the thyroid gland, and a goiter. Genetic sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations R124H and V270E in the SLC5A5 gene, impairing iodide transport and leading to hypothyroidism. While a negative charge at position 270 affects the protein's targeting to the plasma membrane, some functionality remained, allowing for limited iodide uptake and thyroid hormone synthesis that prevented cognitive deficiency."
