        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was established based on the patient's presentation of exertional dyspnea and syncope, the presence of a murmur, and echocardiography results showing marked septal hypertrophy with a resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 68 mm Hg. Family history of sudden cardiac death in relatives also supported the diagnosis, and genetic testing identified a pathogenic mutation in MYH7."
