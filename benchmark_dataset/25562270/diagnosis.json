        "final_diagnosis": "Eruptive xanthoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Non-Langerhans histiocytoses (such as xanthogranuloma), drug eruption, viral exanthema, cutaneous sarcoidosis, arthropod bites",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The distinctive pink-yellow hue and sudden onset of the papules are highly suggestive of eruptive xanthomas, typically associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Laboratory evaluation revealed serum triglyceride levels of 3159 mg/dL, confirming significant hypertriglyceridemia, which supports the diagnosis."
