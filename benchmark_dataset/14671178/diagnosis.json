        "final_diagnosis": "Early-onset severe obesity due to in-frame deletion mutation in the MC4R gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis is supported by the identification of a novel in-frame deletion mutation in the MC4R gene, which was associated with the patient's obesity that started at less than 5 years of age. Functional analysis revealed that the mutant receptor could not bind its ligand or generate cAMP in response to stimulation, indicating that this mutation directly contributes to the obesity phenotype."
