        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis is supported by the presence of two compound heterozygous mutations (L314X and Q106R) in the GnRH receptor gene, which contribute to the absence of LH and FSH response to pulsatile GnRH administration. Laboratory findings included low estradiol and gonadotropin concentrations, along with imaging showing normal pituitary structure, leading to the conclusion of complete hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."
