        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of severe Mandibuloacral Dysplasia was supported by clinical features such as mandibular hypoplasia, joint stiffness, skin thinning, hyperpigmentation, progressive clavicular hypoplasia, acroosteolysis, and severe hair loss. Genetic testing confirmed a novel homozygous missense mutation, p.Arg527Cys, in the LMNA gene, which is associated with MAD. No accumulation of prelamin A was observed, and abnormal nuclear morphology was evident in skin fibroblasts, which were not rescued by various pharmacological interventions."
