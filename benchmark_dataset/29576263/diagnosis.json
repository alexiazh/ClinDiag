        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had multiple lung nodules and a significant number of lesions identified through CT scans. Surgical pathology revealed various types of lung lesions, including invasive adenocarcinoma. A shared somatic mutation in ARID1B across the tumor samples indicated a possible role in lung cancer formation."
