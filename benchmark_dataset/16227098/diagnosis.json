        "final_diagnosis": "A new syndrome involving palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) with multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), dental anomalies, hypogenitalism, and ambiguous genitalia in 46,XX males.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Huriez syndrome, Howel-Evans syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, Olmsted syndrome, Haim-Munk syndrome, Kindler syndrome.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the association of classic nonepidermolytic PPK with multiple cutaneous SCCs, abnormal development of genitalia including severe hypogenitalism, altered plasma sex hormone levels, and family history indicating genetic transmission. Additional tests ruled out known hereditary conditions such as Huriez and Papillon-Lefevre syndromes."
