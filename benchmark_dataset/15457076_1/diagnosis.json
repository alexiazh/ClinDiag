        "differential_diagnosis": "Inflammatory costochondritis, Tietze syndrome, septic costochondritis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited severe pain at the left costal margin following a TRAM flap procedure. Initial imaging and lab tests suggested inflammation, leading to a diagnosis of costochondritis. A shift to an infective cause was considered due to elevated white blood cell count and CRP levels later in the hospitalization. Surgical exploration confirmed granulation tissue and revealed Pseudomonas after abscess formation."
