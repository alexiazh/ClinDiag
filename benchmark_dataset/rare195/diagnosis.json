        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Fraser syndrome was considered due to the observed absence of the eyelid and associated abnormalities in the right eye, in conjunction with the clinical history during pregnancy, including oligohydramnios and complications noted at gestation. The physical examination and ultrasound findings supported the diagnosis, along with the absence of other congenital defects."
