        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The infant presented with symptoms of poor feeding, lethargy, hypothermia, and urine containing blood and gram-negative bacilli, alongside a urine culture that grew >100,000 CFU/mL of ESBL-producing E. coli. The persistent presence of the same resistant strain (ST131-H30Rx) across multiple episodes reinforced the diagnosis of UTI caused by this pathogen. Furthermore, the household survey revealed extensive colonization of the same strain among family members."
