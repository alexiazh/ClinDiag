        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Ms. J was diagnosed with celiac disease after an endoscopy revealed villous shortening and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Despite a normal tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA level, an elevated anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) level supported the diagnosis."
