        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the identification of compound heterozygous mutations in the thyroglobulin (Tg) gene, specifically the 1143delC mutation resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon, and the R2223H missense mutation. Clinical evidence included fetal goiter observed via ultrasound, elevated TSH levels, and low free T4 levels confirming fetal hypothyroidism. Genetic testing confirmed the mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern leading to the observed condition."
