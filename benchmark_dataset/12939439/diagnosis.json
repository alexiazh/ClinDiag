        "final_diagnosis": "Giant dural arteriovenous fistula of the superior sagittal sinus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with transient global aphasia and chronic major depression. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI, MR angiography) revealed dilated cortical veins and a giant dAVF at the superior sagittal sinus. EEG and SPECT scans indicated left frontoparietal dysfunction, correlating with the symptoms noted. Resolution of aphasia and depression occurred after embolization of the fistula, supporting the diagnosis."
