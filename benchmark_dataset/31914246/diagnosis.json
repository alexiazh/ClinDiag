        "final_diagnosis": "Celiac disease and adrenal insufficiency",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Diabetic ketoacidosis, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, neurologic causes, food poisoning, infections, gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., GERD, peptic duodenitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, biliary dyskinesia, cholelithiasis), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypercalcemia, adrenal insufficiency)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms highly suggestive of celiac disease, including recurrent nausea, vomiting, chronic fatigue, and weight loss. Initial treatments for possible GERD and other gastrointestinal conditions were ineffective, and subsequent diagnostic tests (including serological tests and histologic evaluation of duodenal biopsy specimens) confirmed celiac disease. Additional symptoms and laboratory results indicated primary adrenal insufficiency, explaining the patient's fatigue and electrolyte imbalances."
