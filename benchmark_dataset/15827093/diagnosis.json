        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the patient's severe growth failure, with height significantly below the third percentile, elevated serum concentrations of growth hormone (GH), and profoundly low levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and acid-labile subunit. The absence of detectable STAT5b protein was confirmed through immunoblot analysis. Genetic testing identified a novel homozygous insertion mutation in the STAT5b gene that resulted in a truncated protein, leading to the conclusion that STAT5b plays a critical role in GH-stimulated IGF-I expression and normal growth."
