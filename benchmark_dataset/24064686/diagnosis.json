        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient developed acute severe hypercalcemia following immobilization due to traumatic fractures, which was exacerbated by his chronic renal failure. Initial serum calcium levels were significantly elevated, and he had low levels of alkaline phosphatase and severe osteomalacia evident in skeletal histopathology. Hemodialysis corrected his hypercalcemia, indicating a link between the hypercalcemia and his underlying conditions."
