        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of a lytic lesion on the medial aspect of the right clavicle, combined with abnormal laboratory findings such as markedly elevated ESR, macrocytic anemia, proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, and elevated serum total protein level, guided the diagnosis toward multiple myeloma. The patient's significant weight loss and recurrent episodes of chest pain abnormal for typical musculoskeletal pain raised suspicion for a malignant process."
