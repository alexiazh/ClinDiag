        "final_diagnosis": "Otodental syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Otodental syndrome was supported by clinical findings such as bilateral mild-to-moderate hearing loss, delayed and incomplete primary teeth replacement, facial asymmetry, micrognathia, dental anomalies including agenesis of deciduous canines, and characteristics like reduced tongue mobility due to a short frenulum. Additionally, familial presentation of similar anomalies in the twin brother contributed to the diagnosis."
