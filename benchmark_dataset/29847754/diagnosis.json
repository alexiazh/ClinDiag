        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a 10-month history of leg edema, flank pain, hypoalbuminemia, and renal-vein thrombosis. The presentation suggested nephrotic syndrome with a hypercoagulable state. The presence of pulmonary emboli and renal-vein thrombosis pointed towards a nephrotic syndrome as the primary risk factor. An acquired prothrombotic state was suspected given the patient's features and a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy was made based on serologic testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies."
