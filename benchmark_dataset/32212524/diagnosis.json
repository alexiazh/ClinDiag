        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results indicated pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. Laboratory findings including hemolysis markers were investigated. Although acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was a consideration, bone marrow evaluation did not show cancer, and an elevated haptoglobin level argued against significant hemolysis. Ultimately, nucleic acid testing confirmed Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection, leading to the final diagnosis."
