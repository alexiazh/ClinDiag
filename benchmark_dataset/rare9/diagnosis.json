        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Gollop Wolfgang complex was supported by the physical examination that revealed coxa valga, flexion contractures, significant limb shortening, the absence of the patella, and severe varus deformity, which were consistent with the clinical findings. Further diagnostic tests, including radiographic imaging, confirmed the absence of metatarsal and phalanges bones in the affected digits, consistent with Gollop Wolfgang complex."
