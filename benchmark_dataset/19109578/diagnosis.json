        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with blurred vision, periorbital pain, and visual field abnormalities, alongside imaging findings of extensive opacification in the paranasal sinuses, which suggested allergic fungal sinusitis. The erosion of the optic canals and resultant compression of the optic nerve were critical in establishing the diagnosis. The rapid improvement in vision following surgical intervention reinforced the diagnosis."
