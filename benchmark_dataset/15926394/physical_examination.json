            "relevant_findings": "The patient was small and short for her age with no secondary sexual traits. Neurological examination was normal, including full visual fields on confrontational testing. Laboratory results showed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (>150 mIU/L), decreased thyroxine (0.5 /H9262g/dl), and slightly elevated prolactin (45 ng/ml). MRI demonstrated a large homogeneously enhancing sellar lesion with suprasellar extension compressing the optic chiasm.",
            "changes_over_time": "Once thyroid replacement therapy was initiated, the MRI showed nearly complete resolution of the mass within one month, with normalization of the pituitary gland."
