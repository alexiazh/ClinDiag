        "differential_diagnosis": "Secondary pituitary hyperplasia, pituitary macroadenoma, craniopharyngioma, glioma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms consistent with primary hypothyroidism, including bifrontal headaches, maxillary pain, and significant fatigue. Laboratory evaluation revealed markedly elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and low thyroxine levels, consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Imaging showed a sellar mass with characteristics more indicative of hyperplasia (pointed superior margin) rather than a tumor, leading to a diagnosis of secondary pituitary hyperplasia due to hypothyroidism."
