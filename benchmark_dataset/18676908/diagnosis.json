        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by confocal microscopy, which revealed viable Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in biofilm aggregates, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the presence of metabolically active Staphylococcus aureus. This provided compelling evidence of persistent infection despite multiple negative cultures."
