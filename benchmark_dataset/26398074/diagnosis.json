        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation included a 15-year history of progressive distal weakness, delayed muscle relaxation, cardiac arrhythmias, and a family history suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Electromyography showed evidence of myotonia and abnormal muscle activity. The presence of both cardiac manifestations and skeletal muscle weakness, alongside positive genetic testing for CTG repeat expansion, supports the diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1."
