        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on the identification of a heterozygous missense mutation (R201C) in the KCNJ11 gene in two paternal half-siblings. The mutation was not present in the unaffected father, indicating he was likely a mosaic for the mutation restricted to his germline, suggesting a genetic transmission of the mutation to his children."
