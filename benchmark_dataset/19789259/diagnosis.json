        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited progressive craniotubular hyperostosis since early childhood and had characteristic genetic findings associated with Van Buchem disease. Imaging findings, including severe hyperostosis of the skull and facial bones, led to multiple cranial nerve deficits, supporting the diagnosis. Normal laboratory blood tests further reinforced the diagnosis."
