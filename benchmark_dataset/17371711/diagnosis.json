        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a 1-day history of fever and chills, painful erythema, and skin pustules over the left-sided periorbital and glabellar areas. MRI revealed retention cysts and significant changes in the orbital apex, indicating infection. These findings, along with laboratory results showing neutrophilic leucocytosis and hyperglycemic ketoacidosis, led to the diagnosis."
