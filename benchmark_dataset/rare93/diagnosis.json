        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Jalili syndrome was supported by clinical findings such as uncorrected vision, photophobia, and nystagmus, along with diagnostic tests revealing severely reduced responses in both the cone and rod systems of the eyes. Dental evaluations indicated enamel hypoplasia and discolorations in the teeth, which align with the characteristics of Jalili syndrome. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous missense variants in the CNNM4 gene, with one variant classified as likely pathogenic."
