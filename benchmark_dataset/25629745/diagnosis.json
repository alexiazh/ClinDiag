        "final_diagnosis": "Ethylene glycol ingestion",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Trazodone overdose, l-Lactic acidosis, d-Lactic acidosis, Ketoacidosis, Chronic kidney disease, Salicylate ingestion, Pyroglutamic acidosis, Toxic alcohol ingestion",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with obtundation followed by agitation, and toxic screenings revealed trazodone and its metabolite MCPP, along with symptoms consistent with metabolic acidosis. The high anion gap and elevated serum osmolality suggested ethylene glycol ingestion as the most likely diagnosis. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals in urine further supported this diagnosis."
