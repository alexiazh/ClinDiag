        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was supported by the patient's marked joint laxity, skin hyperextensibility, subcutaneous hemorrhages after minor trauma, and the history of significant vascular complications. Furthermore, skin biopsy findings indicated disorganized collagen fibers, and genetic testing revealed specific variants in the AEBP1 gene associated with the condition."
