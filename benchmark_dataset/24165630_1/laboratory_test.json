Case 2: Preoperative radial articular angle 35 degrees, carpal slip 55%, ulnar shortening 22 mm; 2 weeks postoperative showed corrected ulnar shortening; 2 months postoperative showed bone union; 1 year postoperative radial articular angle 30 degrees, carpal slip 50%.",

Case 2: Ulnar shortening improved from 22 mm preoperatively to none at 1 year postoperative, radial articular angle decreased from 35 degrees to 30 degrees."
