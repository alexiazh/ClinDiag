            "changes_over_time": "The morphology and function were satisfactory at 1- and 8-year follow-up. The radial articular angle improved from 40 degrees to 18 degrees, carpal slip decreased from 50 percent to 10 percent, and ulnar shortening improved from 14 mm to 5 mm, with a noted tendency toward premature epiphyseal closure 8 years postoperatively."

            "changes_over_time": "Postoperative observations included correction of ulnar shortening within 2 weeks and bone union noted by 2 months. At 1-year follow-up, the radial articular angle was recorded at 30 degrees and carpal slip at 50 percent, with no recurrence of ulnar shortening."
