    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome and limbic encephalitis with anti-amphiphysin antibodies, most likely due to an underlying malignant tumor.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Fibromyalgia, progressive myelopathy, limbic encephalitis, herpes encephalitis, gliomatosis cerebri.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical presentation, including painful muscle spasms, weakness, hyperreflexia, and increased tone, suggested upper-motor-neuron dysfunction localized to the spinal cord, raising suspicion for stiff person syndrome. The subsequent development of confusion and memory loss pointed toward limbic encephalitis, confirmed by MRI findings that revealed abnormalities in the medial temporal lobes. The presence of anti-amphiphysin antibodies in the blood, along with the patient's symptoms, indicated that the syndromes were likely paraneoplastic, potentially linked to an underlying malignancy."
