        "diagnostic_reasoning": "All patients had a history of noise-induced hearing loss that reportedly worsened in association with tinnitus during antiretroviral therapy. The evidence suggests an association between NRTIs and ototoxicity in older HIV-1-infected patients, with mitochondrial toxicity proposed as a possible mechanism."
