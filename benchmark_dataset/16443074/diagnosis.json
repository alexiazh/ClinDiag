        "final_diagnosis": "PHACE syndrome with midline facial hemangioma and sinus pericranii",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PHACE syndrome was made based on the presence of a large midfacial hemangioma, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and multiple cerebrovascular anomalies, including a hypoplastic internal carotid artery and dysplastic basilar artery, along with the rare finding of sinus pericranii. The patient also exhibited recurrent hemorrhages from the hemangioma despite initial steroid treatment, necessitating endovascular embolization which led to involution of the hemangioma."
