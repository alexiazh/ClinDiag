        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of MRSA from cultures of debrided material showing a susceptible profile to vancomycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline, and resistant to erythromycin. Despite initial clindamycin susceptibility, the strain exhibited inducible clindamycin resistance, confirmed through D testing, following treatment failure and the need for surgical intervention."
