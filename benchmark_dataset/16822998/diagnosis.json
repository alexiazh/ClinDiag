        "differential_diagnosis": "multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, opportunistic infections, malignant tumors, autoimmune conditions, multifocal small-vessel infarction",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's initial presentation with acute neurologic deficits suggested a vascular event, but the multifocal nature and progressive symptoms were inconsistent with a single vascular lesion. The imaging findings indicated multifocal disease affecting the cerebral white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions ruled out conditions like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. A brain biopsy revealed intravascular lymphomatosis, characterized by the presence of large malignant B cells obstructing the cerebral vasculature, causing ischemic damage."
