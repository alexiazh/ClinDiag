        "differential_diagnosis": "Haim Munk syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, reticulate port wine stain, nevus of Ito",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome is supported by the characteristic clinical features of diffuse transgradient palmoplantar keratoderma and periodontitis, along with genetic studies indicating mutations in the cathepsin C gene. Radiographic evaluation ruled out Haim Munk syndrome, which shares similar symptoms. The combination of clinical observations and genetic testing led to a definitive diagnosis."
