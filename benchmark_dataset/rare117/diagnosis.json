        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PFAPA was made based on the patient's recurrent febrile episodes occurring every 3-4 months, resolution of symptoms within 24 hours of fever onset with corticosteroid treatment, and a thorough evaluation that ruled out infections and other potential underlying conditions. Historical evidence of high ESR and leukocytosis during febrile episodes also supported the diagnosis."
