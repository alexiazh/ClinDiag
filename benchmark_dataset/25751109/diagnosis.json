        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on significant liver toxicity observed after the initiation of intravenous glucocorticoids and statins, with normalization of liver function upon discontinuation of statins. Negative hepatitis virus markers and autoimmune serologies helped rule out other causes."
