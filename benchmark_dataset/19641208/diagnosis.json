        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of chronic sclerosing sialadenitis was supported by a marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and florid reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia found upon pathologic examination of the resected submandibular gland, which did not display lymphoepithelial lesions characteristic of Sjögren’s syndrome. Additionally, the absence of granulomatous inflammation or malignant cells in fine-needle aspiration further confirmed the diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and imaging were consistent with chronic sclerosing sialadenitis rather than Sjögren’s syndrome or malignancy."
