        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus was supported by the patient's history of flaccid blisters, positive laboratory tests for rheumatologic disease markers, and consistent pathological findings across multiple skin biopsies suggesting variations of pemphigus. The clinical presentation included erosive skin lesions and mucosal involvement, responding quickly to systemic glucocorticoids, which aligns with characteristics of pemphigus erythematosus."
