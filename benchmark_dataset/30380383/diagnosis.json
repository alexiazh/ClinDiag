        "differential_diagnosis": "Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, IgA nephropathy, Goodpasture's syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history and clinical presentation indicated a connection between the pleural infection (empyema) and the acute renal injury. The renal biopsy revealed IgA deposition and the presence of infection-driven glomerulonephritis, likely linked to the underlying staphylococcal infection. Key laboratory findings of heavy proteinuria and increased serum complement factor 3 levels supported the diagnosis."
