        "final_diagnosis": "Corticotroph pituitary carcinoma",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the presence of a pituitary tumor associated with severe Cushing's disease, hypokalemia, and elevated levels of ACTH. Imaging studies confirmed the tumor's aggressive nature, while MMR analysis indicated mutation consistent with Lynch syndrome (MSH2 mutation), suggesting a link between MMR deficiency and the tumor pathogenesis."
