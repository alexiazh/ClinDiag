        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of posterior fossa infarction was supported by imaging studies showing extensive infarction in the posterior fossa, with normal arterial imaging ruling out arterial dissection or injury. The potential anatomical variant, the arcuate foramen, was considered as a contributing factor to vertebral artery occlusion leading to ischemic injury."
