    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Major depressive disorder, possibly with vascular depression",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Cognitive syndrome, bipolar disorder, dysthymia, adjustment disorder, medical conditions masquerading as depressive syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms over several months, impairing function. Cognitive deficits were mild and aligned with depression onset, ruling out delirium. Bipolar disorder was considered due to late onset and treatment resistance, but mania symptoms were absent. Medical conditions were evaluated but did not explain symptoms; rather, pre-existing cerebrovascular disease and white-matter lesions suggested vascular depression, common in older patients."
