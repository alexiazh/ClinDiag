        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical presentation and recent IT-MTX administration raised concern for MTX neurotoxicity. MRI findings were not consistent with stroke and showed hyperintense signals that do not respect typical vascular territories. As the patient's symptoms began 10 days post-MTX and fluctuated, they aligned with known presentations of subacute MTX neurotoxicity, distinct from typical stroke."
