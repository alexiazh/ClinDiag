        "final_diagnosis": "Enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Genetic analysis revealed novel missense mutations (p.G51R in case 1 and p.R48C/p.R104Q in case 2) in the NR2E3 gene, which is known to cause ESCS. Clinical features of night blindness and high sensitivity to short-wavelength light, along with characteristic findings in funduscopy and electrophysiological tests, supported the diagnosis."
