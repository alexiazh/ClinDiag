Funduscopy revealed retinal degeneration surrounding the vascular arcade with cystic changes in both maculae. Case 2: Diffuse mild retinal degeneration with no pigmentation in both eyes, subtle foveal schisis in the left eye after cataract surgery.",
            "changes_over_time": "Case 1: During 23-year clinical follow-up, clumped pigmentation appeared in the retinal degeneration and the cystic changes in the foveal region became ambiguous; vision decreased to 0.5 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye at age 53. Case 2: Following cataract surgery, vision improved to 0.3 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye."
