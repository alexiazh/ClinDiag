        "final_diagnosis": "Serpiginous ganglion cyst of the foot",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Cutaneous larva migrans",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a serpiginous lesion on the foot, initially interpreted as creeping eruption (larva migrans cutanea). However, clinical evaluation and histologic examination revealed a multilocular cyst consistent with a ganglion cyst, evidenced by the presence of mucoid material and collagen structures with no epithelial lining, leading to the final diagnosis."
