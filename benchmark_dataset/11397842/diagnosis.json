        "final_diagnosis": "Fertile eunuch syndrome due to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was made based on clinical features such as eunuchoidal body proportions, low testosterone levels, and the presence of normal-sized testicles with some degree of spermatogenesis. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous mutation (Gln106Arg) in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, providing the genetic basis for the diagnosis. Follow-up therapy with hCG led to increased testosterone levels and subsequent sperm production, which supported the diagnosis of reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."
