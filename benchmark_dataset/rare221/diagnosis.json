        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of CLN2 disease was supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including progressive cognitive disorder, neuromotor dysfunction, seizures, and vision problems, along with MRI findings. Whole Exome Sequencing identified two novel TPP1 variants associated with the disease, confirmed by Sanger sequencing and functional assays showing impact on transcript splicing."
