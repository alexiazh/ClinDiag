        "final_diagnosis": "Severe encephalomyelitis due to chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Tuberculous meningitis, Coccidioides meningitis, Japanese encephalitis",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of severe encephalomyelitis was supported by the presence of HHV-6 detected in cerebrospinal fluid by PCR, alongside clinical symptoms including pleocytosis, hypoglycorrhachia, and significant MRI findings. The improvement of the patient's condition following the initiation of treatment with foscarnet and ganciclovir further corroborated the diagnosis."
