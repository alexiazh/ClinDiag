        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria was confirmed through examination of peripheral blood films that showed P. falciparum parasites with 0.8% and 14.0% parasitemia on January 11 and January 14, respectively. The patient's return from Africa, presence of symptoms like fever, chills, malaise, and vomiting, along with a post-mortem chloroquine level consistent with recent administration, further supported the diagnosis."
