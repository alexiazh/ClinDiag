        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Scimitar Syndrome was supported by the presence of pulmonary artery hypertension, abnormal echocardiographic findings including partial anomalous venous drainage, right ventricular dilation, and a significant right to left shunt due to interatrial communication. Chest x-ray findings of cardiomegaly and abnormal curvilinear opacities further corroborated this diagnosis."
