        "final_diagnosis": "idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) due to a homozygous GnRH receptor mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of IHH was established based on the patient's clinical presentation of primary amenorrhea, absent secondary sexual characteristics, low serum estrogen levels, and undetectable levels of LH and FSH. Dynamic tests confirmed suppressed gonadotropin secretion and lack of response to GnRH stimulation, while genetic testing identified a novel homozygous splice site mutation in the GnRHR gene, correlating with her phenotype."
