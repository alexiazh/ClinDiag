        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) due to hepatitis A and E co-infection was supported by the patient's clinical presentation of abdominal discomfort, lethargy, jaundice, altered mental status, and laboratory findings of severely elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), total bilirubin, and positive serology for HAV and HEV. Additionally, evidence of active HEV replication was confirmed via PCR, leading to the final diagnosis of Fulminant viral hepatitis."
