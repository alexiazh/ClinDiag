        "final_diagnosis": "fibular aplasia, tibial campomelia, and oligosyndactyly (FATCO syndrome)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of FATCO syndrome was based on the presence of characteristic skeletal deformities in the neonate, including oligodactyly of the right hand, shorter right lower limb due to abnormal tibial angulation, and ectrodactyly. Additionally, imaging studies confirmed the absence of the fibula and demonstrated the malformation in the tibia, along with other physical abnormalities. The family history of congenital anomalies also contributed to the suspicion of a hereditary condition."
