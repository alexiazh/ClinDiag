        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was established based on Ann's history of chronic low self-esteem, impaired functioning, and worsening depressive symptoms including intermittent suicidal ideation, which suggested clinical depression despite not fully meeting the criteria for major depression. Her difficulty in establishing intimate relationships and testing limits due to a fear of abandonment also supported this diagnosis."
