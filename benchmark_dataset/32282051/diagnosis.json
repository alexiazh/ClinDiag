        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by identifying a novel heterozygous deletion variant in exon 8 of the NPR2 gene, which was associated with tall stature and macrodactyly of the great toes. Functional assays demonstrated increased cGMP production in fibroblasts and transfected cells expressing the mutant NPR-B, indicating a gain-of-function that contributed to the observed skeletal overgrowth."
