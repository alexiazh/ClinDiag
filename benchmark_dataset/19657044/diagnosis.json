        "final_diagnosis": "paraganglioma syndrome type 1 (PGL 1) due to SDHD mutation",
        "differential_diagnosis": "malignant pheochromocytoma, metastatic pheochromocytoma",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of PGL 1 was supported by the patient's age (26 years), multifocal and extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, and identification of a germline mutation in the SDHD gene which is associated with the syndrome. Initially, the second tumor was considered a metastasis, but upon re-review, it was concluded to be a second primary tumor, which is consistent with the characteristics of SDHD mutation carriers."
