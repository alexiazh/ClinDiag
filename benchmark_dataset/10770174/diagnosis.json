    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Insulin-like growth factor I deficiency secondary to homozygous partial deletion of the IGF-I gene",
        "differential_diagnosis": "GH receptor deficiency (GHRD)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of IGF-I deficiency was supported by the patient's severe pre- and postnatal growth failure, mental retardation, microcephaly, sensorineural deafness, and molecular studies showing a homozygous IGF-I gene deletion. Elevated GH secretion with undetectable IGF-I levels further confirmed the diagnosis."
