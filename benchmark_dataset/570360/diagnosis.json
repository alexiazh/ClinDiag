        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of agitation, disorientation, memory deficit, incontinence, and coma after increasing the dose of imipramine suggested toxicity. Elevated plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants were confirmed, indicating that the symptoms were likely due to excessive drug levels, as the syndrome resolved after discontinuation of the medication."
