        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The clinical appearance and behavior of the small, firm papules along with the absence of systemic symptoms before chemotherapy were most consistent with lymphomatoid papulosis, particularly the type C variant. The case review highlighted the recurrent, self-resolving nature of the lesions and the characteristics of the biopsies, which were consistent with a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder."
