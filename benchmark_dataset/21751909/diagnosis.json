        "final_diagnosis": "ALK-Positive Adenocarcinoma of the Lung",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, germ-cell tumors, lymphomas, carcinoma of unknown primary site",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with dysphagia and a mediastinal mass causing extrinsic compression of the distal esophagus. Imaging studies indicated an advanced malignant tumor due to significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung nodules. Endoscopic examinations revealed normal esophageal mucosa, making typical esophageal adenocarcinoma unlikely. Biopsy results showed adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells, and immunohistochemical analysis indicated a primary lung adenocarcinoma with ALK gene rearrangement."
