        ],
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's clinical picture of asymmetric weakness, predominant in the hands with absence of sensory loss, and the results of extensive electromyographic assessment showing conduction block and normal sensory nerve conduction suggest multifocal motor neuropathy rather than motor neuron disease. The presence of conduction block, normal sensory conduction, and the absence of significant atrophy or fasciculations further support this diagnosis."
