        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited intrauterine growth restriction and progressive postnatal growth failure, normal hearing, microcephaly, and mild intellectual impairment. Key findings include markedly reduced concentrations of IGF-I with normal or elevated levels of IGFBP-3 and ALS. Genetic sequencing identified a homozygous missense IGF1 mutation (R36Q) which leads to reduced mitogenic activity and partial loss of binding to the receptor IGF-1R. The complexity of the patient's growth failure linked to IGF-I signaling was pivotal for the diagnosis."
