    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Anal squamous-cell carcinoma, positive for human papillomavirus",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was based on the presence of a bulky, malignant-appearing lower rectal mass found during flexible sigmoidoscopy and confirmed by biopsy, which showed characteristics typical of anal squamous-cell carcinoma. Immunostaining revealed strong positivity for p16, indicating high-risk HPV infection, which is associated with the majority of such cases. The patient's history of brachytherapy for prostate cancer may have influenced the development of this malignancy through radiation-induced changes."
