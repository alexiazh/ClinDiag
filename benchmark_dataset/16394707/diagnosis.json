        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Exogenous lipoid pneumonia was suspected based on the patient's history of using large quantities of vaseline oil, confirmed by the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and matching nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectra with the vaseline oil taken by the patient."
