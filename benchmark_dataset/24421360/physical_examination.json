Second case: New dyspnea and left calf pain; Imaging reveals bilateral pulmonary emboli and acute left leg deep vein thrombosis. Laboratory analysis shows reduced hemoglobin (11.4 g/dL), increased red blood cell distribution width (18.9%), and mild thrombocytopenia.",

Case 2 displayed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid peroxidase antibodies, consistent with incipient hypothyroidism from Hashimoto thyroiditis; laboratory results normalized after treatment."
