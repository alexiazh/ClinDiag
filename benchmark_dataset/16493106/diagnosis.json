        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of C-IBS was made based on Mrs G's symptoms of chronic abdominal pain and discomfort associated with constipation, along with her medical history and the exclusion of other organic diseases. Laboratory studies were normal, and a prior colonoscopy was unremarkable. The significant improvement in her symptoms upon treatment with tegaserod supported the diagnosis."
