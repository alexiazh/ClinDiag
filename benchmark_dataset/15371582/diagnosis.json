        "differential_diagnosis": "Subacute bacterial endocarditis, myopericarditis, cardiac ischemia due to increased physiological demand.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's initial presentation included chest pain, fever, and elevated troponin levels. Positive blood cultures identified S. anginosus, meeting major Duke criteria for endocarditis. Echocardiographic findings revealed an aortic-root abscess and vegetations, confirming the diagnosis of endocarditis."
