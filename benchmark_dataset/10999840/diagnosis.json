    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Interstitial duplication of chromosome 16 (16q13)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Williams-Beuren syndrome, Ulnar-mammary syndrome, Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by a high-resolution karyotype that revealed additional chromosomal material on chromosome 16. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the duplication at 16q13, and the unique phenotype involved severe anisomastia and specific dysmorphic features, distinguishing it from other conditions such as Williams-Beuren syndrome."
