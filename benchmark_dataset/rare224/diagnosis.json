        "final_diagnosis": "West-Nile encephalitis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of West-Nile encephalitis was supported by the presence of lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF and positive West Nile Virus IgG in both CSF and serum, alongside negative IgM results, which indicates prior exposure rather than a recent acute infection. The patient's presentation of neurologic symptoms, such as seizures and headaches, along with imaging findings consistent with leukoencephalopathy, further substantiated the diagnosis."
