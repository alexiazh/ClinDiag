    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Autosomal recessive arthropathy syndrome associated with a homozygous mutation in the LMNA gene (S573L)",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, mandibuloacral dysplasia",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a homozygous missense mutation (S573L) in the LMNA gene, which was associated with clinical features of arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and progeroid characteristics, distinguishing it from other syndromes like mandibuloacral dysplasia which typically manifests with acral osteolysis."
