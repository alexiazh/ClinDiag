        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Gongylonema infection was supported by the patient's report of a migrating, serpiginous mass in the mouth, along with the recovery of a female nematode identified as Gongylonema species. The patient's history of potential exposure through food consumed in Mexico and the characteristic clinical findings of the migration of the worm corroborate the diagnosis."
