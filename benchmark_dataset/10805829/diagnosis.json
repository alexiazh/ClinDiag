        "differential_diagnosis": "Community-acquired pneumonia, zoonotic infections (e.g., psittacosis, Q fever, tularemia, and others)",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with a history of pneumonia, exposure to various farm animals, and a culture that yielded a gram-negative rod identified as Francisella tularensis. Other potential causes, such as tuberculosis and cancer, were ruled out due to the negative tuberculin test and negative cultures, along with the presence of high fever and leukocytosis suggesting an infectious process. The exposure history and clinical features aligned with tularemia, particularly given the endemic nature of the disease in the region."
