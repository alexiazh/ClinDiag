            "findings": "The biopsy demonstrated an unusual artifact of complete separation of the epithelium from the underlying intensely inflamed substantia propria. Immunophenotyping disclosed an average of 72 CD-3–positive T lymphocytes and 54 CD-20–positive B lymphocytes. Linear immunoglobulin (Ig)-G and C3 were detected in the basement membrane zone on direct immunofluorescence, consistent with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.",
            "changes_over_time": "Following the conjunctival biopsy, palliative chemotherapy and oral prednisone therapy resulted in significant improvement in ocular inflammation. The patient's ocular surface symptoms ultimately stabilized with treatment. However, her condition deteriorated leading to a tracheostomy and subsequently her death approximately 9 months after her initial diagnoses."

            "date": "Not specified",
            "findings": "The biopsies revealed extensive subepidermal bulla formation with a light to moderate mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and linear/granular subepithelial deposition of IgG and C3 suggestive of cicatricial pemphigoid.",
            "changes_over_time": "After treatment with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin, the oral and skin lesions continued to worsen. The patient's condition deteriorated further, leading to respiratory distress and eventually necessitating intubation and tracheostomy."
