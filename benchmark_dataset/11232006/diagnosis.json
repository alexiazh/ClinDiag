        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis was supported by clinical findings of elevated TSH levels (about 200 mU/mL at diagnosis and still above 100 mU/L at day 32), very low free T4 and T3 levels, and scintigraphy showing a very hypoplastic thyroid gland. Genetic analysis identified a novel loss-of-function mutation in the PAX8 gene causing the observed condition."
