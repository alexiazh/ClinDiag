        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with signs and symptoms of acute meningoencephalitis. CSF analysis revealed elevated opening pressure, mononuclear pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and elevated protein levels. MRI showed leptomeningeal enhancement and abnormal signal hyperintensity in various brain regions. Despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment and CSF testing for various pathogens, adenovirus was ultimately identified in the CSF samples after culture. The patient's immunocompromised status and rapid progression of neurological symptoms supported the diagnosis of adenovirus meningoencephalitis."
