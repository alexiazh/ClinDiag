        "differential_diagnosis": "Myocardial Ischemia, Pericarditis, Pulmonary Embolism, Parenchymal Lung Disease",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin T level were assessed for myocardial ischemia but was deemed unlikely due to the pain's positional nature and unresponsiveness to ischemic treatment. Other potential causes like pericarditis and embolism were considered and ruled out with relevant diagnostic findings. The elevated troponin and clinical presentation suggested myocarditis, likely related to nivolumab treatment."
