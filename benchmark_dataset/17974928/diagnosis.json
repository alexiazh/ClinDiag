        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The presence of dysmorphic features, including bilateral ptosis and two-to-three toe syndactyly, along with a confirmed elevated plasma 7-dehydrocholesterol level provided key evidence for the diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. Given the patient's autism spectrum disorder symptoms, the combination of these findings was indicative that Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome was the underlying cause."
