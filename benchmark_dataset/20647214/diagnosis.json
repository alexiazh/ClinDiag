        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with symptoms consistent with acromegaly, including oligomenorrhea, visual disturbances, and extensive clinical signs such as increased facial hair and weight gain. MRI imaging revealed a lesion in the sella turcica consistent with a pituitary adenoma. Key laboratory findings included elevated IGF-1 levels and elevated growth hormone after glucose suppression test, corroborating the diagnosis of active acromegaly due to a growth hormone–secreting pituitary macroadenoma."
