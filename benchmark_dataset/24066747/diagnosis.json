    "diagnosis": {
        "final_diagnosis": "Acute infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein–Barr virus infection, complicated by acute otitis media and postinfectious cerebellitis.",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Guillain–Barré syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, Miller Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff’s brain-stem encephalitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, gluten sensitivity.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's history of upper respiratory tract infection, positive heterophile antibody test, otitis media, and bilateral cerebellar dysfunction supported the diagnosis of postinfectious cerebellitis secondary to EBV. Imaging studies ruled out significant intracranial lesions, leading to a conclusion of immune-mediated cerebellitis post EBV infection."
