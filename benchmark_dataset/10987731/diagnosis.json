        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by serological testing revealing positive IgG antibodies to Bartonella henselae, the patient's history of cat scratches, and MRI findings showing cord edema consistent with a diffuse inflammatory process. The absence of typical adenopathy and typical findings in other diagnostic tests also pointed toward cat-scratch disease despite these anomalies."
