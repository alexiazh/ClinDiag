        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by whole-exome sequencing which identified heterozygous variants in the ACAN gene, associated with short stature, advanced bone age, and premature growth cessation. All affected individuals had identified mutations that cosegregated with the phenotype, demonstrating biological plausibility given the role of aggrecan in cartilage. Normal endocrine evaluations alongside unique clinical presentations confirmed this novel genetic etiology."
