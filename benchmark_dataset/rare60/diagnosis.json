        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) was supported by the patient's recurrent episodes of mycobacterial lymphadenitis and disseminated tuberculosis, alongside a positive family history of similar conditions. Genetic testing confirmed two pathogenic homozygous variants in the IL12RB1 gene, consistent with the diagnosis."
