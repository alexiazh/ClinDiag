        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was established after identifying a 'cove-type' ST elevation and right bundle branch block on the electrocardiogram, which became evident postoperatively in the context of electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyperkalemia, and the administration of amiodarone. These findings were a marked change from the patient's preoperative ECG and were temporally related to surgery and medication adjustments."
