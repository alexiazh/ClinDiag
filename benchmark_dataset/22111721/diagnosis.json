        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with sudden chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG, but coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructions in the coronary arteries. The left ventriculogram and echocardiogram indicated left ventricular dysfunction with akinesis and hypokinesis, characteristic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The minimal elevation in biomarkers for myocardial necrosis also supported this diagnosis."
