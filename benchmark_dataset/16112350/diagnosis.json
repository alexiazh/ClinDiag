        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The final diagnosis of lymphangioma circumscriptum was supported by the biopsy results which revealed lymphangioma circumscriptum with associated mild chronic inflammation. Clinical findings included multiple clear vesicles and hemorrhagic papules exacerbated by physical contact, which were characteristic of this condition. Follow-up examinations confirmed complete resolution after treatment with hypertonic saline sclerotherapy."
