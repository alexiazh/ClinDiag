        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's physical examination showed signs consistent with premature adrenarche, specifically the presence of pubic hair at an early age without breast tissue development. Hormonal evaluations indicated elevated adrenal androgens appropriate for her Tanner stage, and a normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone level further supported a diagnosis of idiopathic premature adrenarche rather than Virilizing tumors or NC-CAH."
