        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both twins had a 46,XX karyotype with SRY gene absent in both peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissues. Twin A demonstrated male characteristics, including a phallus with chordee and bilateral testes, while Twin B exhibited features of OT-DSD with genital ambiguity and a left gonad classified as an ovotestis. Hormonal evaluations further supported the distinct diagnoses."
