        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited a combination of waxing and waning skin lesions, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and pulselessness in both arms. The histology of the skin biopsy indicated granulomatous dermatitis, and imaging studies revealed occlusion of the left subclavian artery, indicating a systemic process. The most likely diagnosis based on the patient's demographic features, symptoms, and imaging findings is Takayasu's arteritis, supported by fulfilling diagnostic criteria for the condition."
