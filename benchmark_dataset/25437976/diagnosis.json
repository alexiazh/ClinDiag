        "final_diagnosis": "Bullous amyloidosis",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Bullous pemphigoid, linear immunoglobulin A, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, bullous lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous drug eruption",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of bullous amyloidosis was supported by the presence of multiple tense bullae and nodules on the patient's lower extremities, the results of the punch biopsy showing amorphous pink material in the dermis, and evidence of monoclonal protein in serum and urine. The clinical and histopathologic findings fitting the profile of amyloidosis, including skin manifestations and absence of plasma cell increase in the bone marrow, further substantiated the diagnosis."
