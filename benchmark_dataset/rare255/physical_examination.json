            "relevant_findings": "Neurological examination showed ataxia and hypotonic posture with severe atrophy of all four limbs. Upper limbs demonstrated a Medical Research Council muscle strength grading of 3, lower limbs graded 2. Deep tendon reflexes were absent, with contracture of bilateral ankles. Babinski reflexes were down-going, and no ankle clonus was elicited. Lack of withdrawal response to pain stimulus, suggesting reduced sensation, particularly over the lower limbs. Limited cranial nerves assessment revealed bilateral horizontal nystagmus with intact vision. Abdomen was scaphoid with no palpable mass or hepatosplenomegaly. Respiratory and cardiovascular examination were unremarkable.",
            "changes_over_time": "Worsening of cerebellar signs and significant global developmental delay. Initially presented with normal neurological signs in infancy that declined over time."
