        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Both patients presented with hypoglycemia within 30 minutes after birth, and subsequent diagnostic workup confirmed congenital hyperinsulinism (CH). Patient 1 had a confirmed mutation (homozygous ABCC8) characteristic of hyperinsulinism, while Patient 2 exhibited elevated insulin and C-peptide during hypoglycemic episodes, supporting the diagnosis despite no known mutations identified."
