        "differential_diagnosis": "Crouzon syndrome, Apert syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patients with progressive postnatal craniosynostosis exhibit midface hypoplasia or hypertelorism at first but later develop multiple-suture craniosynostosis postnatally. Clinical, radiological, and ophthalmological evidence points to increased intracranial pressure, requiring surgical intervention. A significant number showed mutations in FGFR2, commonly seen in Crouzon syndrome, suggesting that they may actually represent a subset of this syndrome."
