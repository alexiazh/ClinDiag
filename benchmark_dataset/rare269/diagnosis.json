        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis was supported by the repeat liver biopsy revealing histiocytes infiltrating the biliary tree with chronic biliary tract injury, along with positive staining for CD1a and S100, which are markers for Langerhans cells. Additionally, the presence of BRAFV600E-mutated protein further supports this diagnosis."
