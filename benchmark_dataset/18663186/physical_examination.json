            "changes_over_time": "Initial improvement of bradykinesia and rigidity with IVIg treatment, but symptoms progressed significantly during participation in a placebo-controlled trial, leading to profound rigidity and bradykinesia, severe gaze ophthalmoparesis, dysphagia, incontinence, and violent tremors. After resumption of IVIg, there was significant improvement in ophthalmoparesis, tremor, and ability to ambulate, but extremity stiffness remained."
