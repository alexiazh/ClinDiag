        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with muscle stiffness, bradykinesia, and prominent supranuclear gaze palsy, mimicking progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) was supported by the elevation of anti-GAD antibodies and unique VNG findings of progressively delayed saccade latency, which are not typical findings in PSP."
