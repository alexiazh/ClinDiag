        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient exhibited symptoms such as fever, joint swelling, rash, severe myalgia, and arthralgia after 14 days of minocycline therapy. Positive antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and improvement of symptoms after discontinuation of minocycline supported the diagnosis of drug-induced lupus. The patient's profile matched known characteristics of minocycline-induced reactions."
