        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The initial suspicion was for pancreatic carcinoma, but the resolution of the pancreatic mass without specific cancer therapy suggested a non-malignant process, such as infection. The presence of granulomas on fine-needle aspiration and the patient's immigration history from a region with higher tuberculosis incidence pointed towards a diagnosis of intraabdominal tuberculosis."
