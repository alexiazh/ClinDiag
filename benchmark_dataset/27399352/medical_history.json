        "history_of_present_illness": "Sibling 1, a 15-month-old boy, presented after falling and fracturing his left wrist, with radiographic findings of widened physes and metaphyseal cupping. Laboratory data confirmed hypocalcemia at 7.9 mg/dl and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Sibling 2, a 4-day-old girl, had low serum calcium levels of 7.2 mg/dl at birth, which improved with formula feeding but showed hypocalcemia at 7 weeks with a serum calcium of 6.4 mg/dl, consistent with calcipenic rickets.",
        "past_medical_history": "Both siblings were compound heterozygous for two novel mutations in the CYP27B1 gene causing Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 (VDDR-1).",
        "family_history": "Parents are nonconsanguineous and asymptomatic. Genetic testing of parents was not available.",
        "social_history": "Sibling 1 was well-nourished, having been breastfed for 3 months before switching to vitamin D-fortified formula. Sibling 2 was feeding well at the time of the hypocalcemic episode."
