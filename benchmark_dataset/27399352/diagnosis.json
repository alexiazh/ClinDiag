        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of VDDR-1 was confirmed through CYP27B1 gene analysis showing compound heterozygous mutations (H441Y and R459L) in patients presenting with calcipenic rickets and normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, indicating defective 1Î±-hydroxylase activity. The clinical data showed a severe loss of activity in the conversion of 25OHD to 1,25OHD due to these mutations which disrupt interactions with the electron transport partner FDX1."
