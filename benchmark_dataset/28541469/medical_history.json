Initially diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, he showed no clinical response to treatment over two months. His hemoglobin nadired at 6.6 g/dl, and he received 8 units of red blood cells.

Treatment with increased doses and additional medications led to normalization of haptoglobin and negative PCR for Babesia DNA.",
