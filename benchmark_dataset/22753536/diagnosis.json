        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's presentation of heart failure symptoms, echocardiographic findings showing severe mitral regurgitation despite normally contracting myocardium, and the identification of a 90% lesion in the left anterior descending artery. Successful percutaneous coronary angioplasty resulted in rapid resolution of heart failure and improvement of mitral regurgitation, confirming its ischemic origin."
