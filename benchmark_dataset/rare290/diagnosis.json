        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of radiation proctitis was supported by the patient's history of prior radiotherapy for prostate cancer, clinical presentation of intermittent rectal bleeding, and findings from colonoscopy which showed diffuse angioectasia, edematous rectal mucosa, and mucosal surface erosion with dense inflammatory cell infiltrate consistent with grade 2 radiation proctitis. Improvement was noted after treatment with M-B enema therapy."
