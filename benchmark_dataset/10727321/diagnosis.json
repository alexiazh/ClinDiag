        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with yellowish papules and plaques on the skin, which were consistent with the characteristic cutaneous features of PXE. Family history of similar manifestations and biopsy findings showing abnormal calcium deposition supported the diagnosis. It was noted that these lesions developed further in response to treatment with vitamin D3, indicating a sensitivity of PXE-affected tissues to this vitamin."
