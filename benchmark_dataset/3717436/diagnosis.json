        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Patients with globus hystericus syndrome typically present with a fear of choking and difficulty swallowing. In the reported cases, antidepressants alleviated the symptoms, which supports an underlying psychological basis related to depression. The lack of organic pathology and improvement with antidepressant treatment suggests a psychosomatic component rather than a purely physical disorder."
