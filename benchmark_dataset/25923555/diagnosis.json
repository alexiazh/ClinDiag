        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient's symptoms of breathlessness and decreased exercise tolerance, along with the CT findings of bilateral peripheral nodules and pleural thickening, led to considering various diagnoses. The minimal abnormalities found on pulmonary-function tests, combined with symptom severity, raised suspicion of a nonpulmonary cause like statin-induced myopathy, but these symptoms were not wholly explained by this diagnosis. Ultimately, the histopathological findings of marked pleural thickening and dense fibroelastotic tissue suggested idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis."
