        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient presented with unexplained dyspnea attributed to a superior SVD. Key findings included right atrial and right ventricular dilation, elevated right-sided pressures on catheterization, and evidence of a left-to-right shunt indicated by the increase in oxygen saturation from the superior vena cava to the right atrium. Imaging supported the diagnosis of SVD with an associated anomalous venous return."
