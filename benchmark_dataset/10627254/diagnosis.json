        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. Estrada's diagnosis was supported by a combination of symptoms including persistent dizziness, later identified as linked to pulmonary sarcoidosis evidenced by chest radiographs showing widespread cystic disease and bilateral hilar adenopathy, alongside his biopsy results indicating noncaseating granulomata. The recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma was confirmed through surgical intervention procedures resulting in surgery for recurrence."
