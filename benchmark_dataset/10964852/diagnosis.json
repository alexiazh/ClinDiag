        "diagnostic_reasoning": "Mr. A exhibits a clear history of bipolar disorder characterized by recurrent manic episodes, often with psychotic features. While there is uncertainty regarding the classification of schizoaffective disorder due to the absence of mood symptoms during episodes of psychosis, the majority of his clinical presentation supports a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Various factors such as self-mutilation history, hypomanic mood states, and the psychotic symptoms exhibited during manic episodes led to this conclusion."
