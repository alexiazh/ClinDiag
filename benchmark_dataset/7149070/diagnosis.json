        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patient had a documented history of systemic lupus erythematosus and presented with severe depressive symptoms and psychotic features that faile to respond to high-dose steroids or psychotropic medications but improved dramatically with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Laboratory findings indicated active lupus, and an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile suggested lupus cerebritis, supporting the diagnosis of an organic affective disorder."
