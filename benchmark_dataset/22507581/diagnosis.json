        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was confirmed through mutation analysis showing a hemizygous stop codon mutation in the ABCD1 gene, along with high levels of very-long-chain fatty acids in the patient and his family members. The patient's symptoms such as diffuse hair loss, distal amyotrophy, and neurologic findings supported the diagnosis."
