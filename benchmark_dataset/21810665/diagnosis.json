        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of very preterm preeclampsia was based on the presence of hypertension, proteinuria, and elevated circulating levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) in women presenting between 27 to 32 weeks of gestation. Elevated sFlt-1 levels are associated with the typical manifestations of preeclampsia, and treatment aimed at reducing sFlt-1 was hypothesized to stabilize maternal and fetal outcomes."
