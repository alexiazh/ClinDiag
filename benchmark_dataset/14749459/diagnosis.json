        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma was established through biopsy, which showed characteristic histologic features, including sheets and fascicles of rounded and spindled cells. The immunohistochemical staining indicated strong expression of desmin and muscle-specific actin, confirming the diagnosis. Imaging studies like CT and MRI initially suggested a mass affecting the orbital musculature, displacing the optic nerve, with no evidence of bony erosion or distant disease."
