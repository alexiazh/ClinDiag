        "differential_diagnosis": "Otosclerosis, Chiari Malformation Type 1, Near-dehiscence",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of Familial Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome (SCDS) was supported by the presence of auditory and vestibular symptoms among first-degree relatives, as well as confirmed bony defects via CT imaging. Similar skull base topography and anatomical defects were observed among family members, suggesting a potential genetic link."
