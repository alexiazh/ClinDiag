        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis was supported by the patient's family history of multiple adenomatous polyps and the presence of polyps in her father and brother. The inheritance pattern was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission, and the number of polyps (more than 50) is characteristic of a polyposis syndrome. The features were most consistent with attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, particularly given the right-sided predominance of adenomas. The risks and patterns of inheritance noted in the family further validated the diagnosis."
