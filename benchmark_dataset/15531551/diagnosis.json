        "final_diagnosis": "Bartter syndrome",
        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The patients presented with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with classic Bartter syndrome, such as hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and very low urinary calcium excretion. Genetic screening revealed novel mutations in the ClC-Kb gene, which is associated with Bartter syndrome, supporting the diagnosis despite the atypical presentation of hypocalciuria."
