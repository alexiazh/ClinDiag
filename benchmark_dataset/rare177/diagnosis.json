        "differential_diagnosis": "Not specified.",
        "diagnostic_reasoning": "The diagnosis of patent urachus was supported by the clinical presentation of persistent umbilical wetness in the baby and findings from the micturating cystourethrogram, which confirmed specifics of the condition. Initial ultrasound revealed a cystic lesion on the umbilical cord, which was closely monitored due to size increase and associated non-reassuring fetal monitoring, culminating in emergency delivery."
